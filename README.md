Plan:

do model classification locally on bart w/ hugging face (will be finetuned locally)
do prompt rephrasing with together api (will be finetuned on together api)
do all other inference on together api

We will need two datasets (will likely want ~2k examples):
one in which there are a bunch of prompts with the model rankings
one in which there are the same prompts with GOOD rephrasings
