{"question": "Asia is home to more than half of the world's population and three of the four most crowded countries are in Asia. China, India, and Indonesia alone have more than 2.5 billion people. Until recently, most Asian nations fell behind the western countries in many fields. Government reform , however, has led to important progress in each of these Asian countries. Across the area, education systems have been improved and economies  have been growing. Most Asian countries now have a system of compulsory  education. Many countries have recently allowed private universities to be built, which was not allowed before. There are more chances for students to go to university now. However, in Asia, there are still not enough chances for students to get higher education and many people prefer to go abroad for further study. As a result, India, China, South Korea, Japan and other Asian countries send thousands of students to study in the United States and Europe each year. Part of the people in Asian countries can speak English, and English has become the most important language for business across the area. The percentage  is the largest in Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, SriLanka and South Korea. Many people in China, India and Malaysia can also speak English.

Complaints were seen a year-on-year decrease from 2006 to 2008. Ma said some poor families might still overlook what they should do to get support for their child. To ensure education equality, the government has introduced a set of favorable policies to help poor students, such as scholarships, grants, student loans, tuition waivers  and the work-study programs under which poor students are helped out in libraries, teachers' offices or service departments to earn money. Statistics show the government spent 29.3 billion yuan last year to aid college students, up 7.6 percent from the previous year.

{"question": "How can you help kids cope with  stress? Proper rest and good nutrition can improve coping skills, so can good parenting. Make time for your kids each day. Whether they need to talk with you or just be in the same room with you, make yourself available. Even as kids get older, quality time is important. It's really hard for some people to come home after a tiring day of work, get down on the floor, and play with their kids or just talk to them about their day -- especially if they've had a stressful day themselves. But expressing interest in your kids shows that they' re important to you. Help your child deal with stress by talking about what may be causing it. Together, you can come up with a few solutions.  For example, he should cut back on after-school activities, spending more time talking with his parents or teachers, developing an exercise plan or keeping a journal. You can also help by predicting potentially stressful situations and preparing kids for them. For example, let a child know ahead of time, but not too far ahead of time, that a doctor's appointment is coming up and talk about what will happen there. Keep in mind, though, that younger kids probably won't need too much advance preparation. Too much information can cause more stress. Remember that some level of stress is normal, Let kids know that it's OK to feel angry, scared, lonely, or anxious and that other people share those feelings, too. When kids can't or won't discuss these problems, try talking about your own concerns. This shows that you're willing to handle tough topics and are available to talk with when they're ready. If a child shows symptoms that concern you and is unwilling to talk, consult a counselor  or other mental health experts. Most parents have the skills to cope with their children's stress. The time to seek professional attention is when any change in behavior continues to exist, when stress is causing serious anxiety, or when the behavior is causing significant problems in functioning at school or at home.

These billboards not only tell me what to drink, but also how to look. Our society place more importance on a person's physical beauty, rather than their ability, honesty and character. We have influenced women to go through painful surgeries and starve themselves to become this society built physical model. To be a beautiful woman in the 21st century doesn't mean that you are a brilliant doctor or caring mother. It means you have the perfect jaw, eyes and lips. It means that you can be six feet tall and weigh one hundred and ten pounds. But what about the women who are starting to leave their youth? Instead of looking at aging as a sign of wisdom, we try to prevent the aging process . It's a kind of funny thing to want to look eighteen when fifty. Fifty is a relaxed age, when you can step back and look at all you've achieved (successfully complete something). It is when your hard work pays off. Unfortunately, our society just sees you as \"old\". To stop the aging process, women buy wrinkle  creams, do eye lifts and face lifts. They spend thousands of dollars to win the hopeless battle against age. I remember when I was about thirteen years old and going through teens, I had oily hair, and a half developed body.

One place where children _ A characteristics is school, which is, by its very nature, a highly competitive institution. Too many schools adopt the \"win at all costs\" moral standard and measure their success by sporting achievements. The current passion for making children compete against their classmates or against the clock produces a two-layer system, in which competitive A types seem in some way better than their B-type fellows. Being too keen to win can have dangerous consequences: remember that Pheidippides,  the first marathon runner, dropped dead seconds after saying,\"Rejoice, we conquer!\". By far the worst form of competition in school is the disproportionate emphasis on examinations. It is a rare school that allows pupils to concentrate on those things they do well. The merits of competition by examination are somewhat questionable, but competition in the certain knowledge of failure is positively harmful. Obviously, it is neither practical nor desirable that all A youngsters change into Bs.

If you are afraid you don't discipline your children enough,the evidence of parental failure is right there in front of everyone. The child is not filling out her college applications ! lf you are afraid that you have allowed your children to watch too much television and settle for low grades,you will have to answer for the consequences. The over-involvement of many parents in the process is,from my perspective,a cover for  this deep parental anxiety: Did I do a good job with this child? Did I do everything I needed to do for this child? Is this child going to have a good life? I have seen manv parents,dive back into their children's lives at college admission time, trying to fill all of their wisdom and discipline into their children at the last moment. Parents may need to be sure as their children leave the nest that they reall} have taught them how to fly. Since it is impossible to assess the quality of what parents have done for their children at this point,the next best thing is the status of the colege to which the child is admitted. From the point of an anxious parent,an \"Ivy l,eague college\" child is proof of better child rearing than a \"small college\" child. I once sat with a talented,weak senior girl and her brilliant parents. She,they,and the school had to decide whether she should remam m school or go into a hospital. In light of her anorexia(   ) ,the school recommended strongly that she not file her early application to Princeton. Upon hearing this,the girl looked at the adults in the room and said,\"If I can't apply early to Princeton,l'll die. \" Her parents were also eager to have her get into Princeton. Why did they all need this so desperately? Because,in this case,something was wrong in the family. Due to some weakness in her upbringing,this child was not happy or self-confident. Yet she was eighteen,the culture required her to leave home. The psychological solution for them all was the comforting vision of a great college. Somehow going there would make her life fine and defend her parents' child rearing. Such fears about letting go of an unfmished child exist in all families. How can we let go of a child who is still so young in so many ways? It is painful and has no cure except time and hope.

Impatience sometimes brings improvements in relations with other people, but usually it does not.

If you want to live in a society that opens to changes, new things and different opinions, be the cat among the pigeons . 5Move out of your comfort zone.Go and sit next to someone different.And don't just sit there in silence.Say hello.Ask a question.Start a conversation.That's how we make friends.That's how we learn about people.That's how we open our minds to new ideas.That's how we live an exciting life.

And Chelsea wanted to make her own money and be more independent. Kim didn't worry about her daughter because she'd known the store owner for years. Chelsea did such a good job that when summer ended she was asked to stay on and even open and close the shop sometimes. That was when Kim started feeling uneasy. \"She'd be there alone with a drawer full of money for the first or last 20 minutes of her shift ,\"  says Kim. \"If she was opening, I'd drop her off to lock the door the minute she got into the building, and I'd wait in the car until the owner arrived.

Stubbornly,we wait for someone else to reach out to us -- believing this is the only way we can forgive or _ a friendship or family relationship. A friend of mine,recently told me that she hadn't spoken to her son in almost three years.

Tibetan Antelopes Tibetan antelopes   are medium-sized animals. They mainly feed on grass. They are usually found in groups of about 20. They are killed for their wool, which is warm, soft and fine and can be made into expensive clothes. Although people can get the wool without killing the animals, people simply kill them before taking the wool. The number of them is dropping year by year.

When I was in the eighth grade, I had a friend. We were shy and \"too serious\" about our studies when it was becoming fashionable with our classmates to learn acceptable social behaviors.

In 1935 August Piccard dived 10330 feet. In 1960 his son Jean dived to a depth of 35 800 feet. All these early dives were deep. But the divers could not stay down for very long.

{"question": "Industrial pollution is not only a problem for the countries of Europe and North America but also an extremely serious problem in some developing countries. For these countries, economic growth is a very important aim. They want to introduce industries, and so they put few controls on the industries which cause pollution. Cubatao, an industrial town of 85 000 people in Brazil, is an example of the connection between industrial development and pollution. In 1954, Cubatao had no industry. Today it has more than twenty large factories, which produce many pollutants . The people of the town are suffering from the poisonous matter in their environment and the bad effects can be clearly seen. Birth shortcomings are extremely common. Among children and adults, lung problems are sometimes twelve times more common in Cubatao than in other places. It is true that Brazil, like many other countries, has laws against pollution, but these laws are not enforced strictly enough. It is cheaper for companies to take no notice of the laws and pay the fines  than to buy the expensive equipment that will reduce the pollution. It is clear, therefore, that economic growth is more important to the government than to the health of the workers. However, the responsibility  does not completely lie with the Brazilian government. The example of Cubatao shows that international companies are not acting in a responsible way either. A number of the factories in the town are owned by large companies from France, Italy, and the U. S. They are doing things in Brazil that they would not be able to do at home. If they caused the same amount of pollution at home, they would be severely  punished or even put out of business.

Lead researcher Omri Gillath said the judgments were based on the style,cost,color and condition of someone's shoes.In the study,63 University of Kansas researchers looked at pictures showing 208 different pairs of shoes worn by the study's participants.Volunteers in the study were photographed in their most commonly worn shoes,and then filled out a personality questionnaire.

{"question": "Who is the most powerful woman in the world? According  to the US media, it's Janet Yellen, or at least she's about to be. On Oct 9, 2013,US President Barack Obama nominated  Yellen to serve as the next US Federal Reserve (the Fed, )chair. If confirmed by the Senate, Yellen will become  the first woman to serve in the top spot. Aged 67, silver-haired and tiny, Yellen is said to be the most qualified nominee ever. She chaired President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, taught at Harvard and Berkeley, and was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. She is currently the Fed's vice chair. Many think Yellen is the right choice to deal with the challenges the Fed now faces:First, to bring interest rates back to more normal levels without triggering a new recession .Second, to reduce the US unemployment rate, which remains at historically high levels. A CNN opinion piece says Yellen is unusual for an economist of her caliber .\"She has kept her eyes on what's critical-the people. Her research has centered on unemployment, on the best way to modulate government policies to benefit the people.\" Past records also show that Yellen is exceptionally good at predicting where the economy is headed. An article in The Washington Post points out that she was one of the few voices at the Fed inDecember 2009 warning about the subprime crisis and the following recession. The reason why Yellen will be the most powerful woman in the world has to do with the unique position of the Federal Reserve, explains an article on Quartz, a US news outlet for business people in the new global economy, First of all, the Fed is independent. Unlike US Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Hilary Clinton, the decisions made by the organization Yellen will lead next year are not subject to approval by anyone in the government. Within the Fed, the chair alone sets the agenda. The Fed chairperson has huge influence on monetary policy and financial regulation. And don't forget how powerful the Fed itself is. It controls the money supply in the world's largest economy. The Fed's interest rate decisions don't just set the course for the US economy, its decisions set the course for the world economy, too. Because of globalization, Yellen's decisions will affect everyone around the world, says an article in The Atlantic, making her even more powerful than some great women rulers in history,  including Elizabeth I of England and China's Wu Zetian. For example, the article continues: \"If Yellen even just talks about slowing down the Fed's bond-buying, Europe's troubled economies are likely to see their interest rates rise, and emerging markets, some of which, like India and Indonesia, used foreign capital to fund their current account deficits ,are likely to see their currencies collapse.\" Janet Yelien will be the most powerful woman in the world because   _   *", "subject": "social sciences", "choices": "['the Fed is the most powerful organization in the US'\n 'Yellen gets full support from Obama'\n 'Yellen holds a unique position in the government'\n 'the Fed possesses great power and influence']", "answer": "3"}

{"question": "Expressing emotions is important rather than hiding them or keeping them inside. Everyone feels negative emotions such as anger and needs to deal with them. But there are healthy ways to express anger and ways to control it. Shouting bad words at someone will hurt the other person or make them angry too. If you feel angry, it is best to think before you speak. Some people in the UK use the expression \"take a deep breath and count to 10\", meaning take a pause, breathe deeply and let yourself calm down instead of getting angry. Another expression people use to say they are controlling their anger is \"biting their lip\". This means not letting the bad words come out of their mouth. If you cannot think of anything but bad words, it is probably best to \"bite your lip.\" But sometimes letting all your anger out can be cathartic , as long as you do it at the right place and time. If you have just had a bad day, you could go into a room by yourself and scream or yell very loudly. Or if you want to hit someone or smash something, you could hit a pillow instead. Then after you let your frustration out this way, you'll be able to deal with your problems more calmly. If you do lose your temper with someone and swear at them, though, you need to apologize. One way to do this is to say \"pardon my French\". This expression has been used for many years as an apology for bad language. Then you can calmly explain what made you upset.

However, we wish to make a number of complaints concerning the serious delay in delivery and your failure to carry out our instructions regard to this order. It was firmly pointed out from the beginning that the delivery date had to be less than six weeks from the original order in order to satisfy our own customers' requirements. While we understand that delays in production are occasionally unavoidable, we must point out that the major reason why the order was placed with your company was that we were assured by you of its simplicity, and that your existing stocks were sufficiently high to ensure immediate shipment. Late delivery of the goods has caused us to disappoint several of our most valued customers, and will have an unfavorable effect on future orders. The second complaint concerns the difference in colour between the watches we ordered and those delivered. It was stated clearly in the order that watches in combinations of green/purple and orange/purple only were required. However, only half the watches in the delivery received are of the colours specified. Our Hong Kong agent informed you of the importance of following our instructions exactly, since we consider there to be only a limited market in this country for watches of other color1s at the present time. Any watches that are not of the specified colours will, of course, be returned to you. We are also somewhat concerned about the rather poor quality of the goods received, since it is obvious that the watches that finally arrived have been made from not good enough materials and have been produced to a lower standard than those in the sample. We have also found that a number of the watches do not appear to be working. Whether the latter problem is due to poor production, or damage in transportation is not yet clear, but we should like to point out that we feel this matter to be entirely your fault. As a result of the above problems, therefore, we feel that the most suitable course of action is to return to you unpaid any of the goods considered unsatisfactory.

{"question": "The life-long benefits of teaching children good money habits make it well worth the effort. Children who are not taught these lessons pay the consequences for a life time. Some parents don't teach children about money because they think they shouldn't talk about money with children, don't have the time, or think they don't have enough money. Parents should take the time to teach children about money regardless of their income and should start when children are young. Most people have strong feelings and opinions about money, based on childhood experiences and the values and beliefs of their families. Most often, these experiences, values, and beliefs are different for each parent. It is important for the healthy development of children that parents talk about these feelings and opinions and establish a consistent approach to teaching children about money. Here are some guidelines parents can keep in mind as they begin the financial socialization of their children: Advise rather than order how the child's money should be used.

Today my friends show off the more unpleasant aspects of their personalities via FaceBook. No longer hidden, they're thrown in my face like TV commercials -unavoidable and endless advertisements for the worst of their personalities. Take Fred.

{"question": "If parents bring up child with the aim of turning the child into a genius , they will cause great damage to him. According to several leading educational psychologists , this is one of the biggest mistakes which some parents make. Generally, the child will understand very well what the parent expects, and will fail. Unrealistic  parental expectations can cause great damage to children. However, if parents are not unrealistic about what they expect their children to do, but are hopeful in a sensible   way, the child may succeed in doing very well -- especially if the parents are very supportive (,) of their child. Michael Li is very lucky. He is very fond of music, and his parents help him a lot by taking him to concerts and arranging private piano and violin lessons for him. They even drive him 50 kilometres twice a week for violin lessons. Although Michael's mother knows very little about music, Michael's father plays the trumpet   in a large orchestra  . However, he never makes Michael enter music competitions if he is unwilling. Michael's friend, Winston Chen, however, is not so lucky. Although both his parents are successful musicians, they set too high a standard for Winston. They want their son to be as successful as they are and so they enter him in every piano competition held. They are very unhappy when he does not win. \"When I was your age, I used to win every competition I entered.\" Winston's father tells him.

{"question": "Do you have an emotional brain or a rational   one? Researchers at Australia's Monash University have found actual difference in the brains of people who respond emotionally to others' feelings compared with those who respond more rationally. A study published in the journal NeuroImage has looked at whether people who have more brain cells in certain areas of the brain are better at certain types of empathy, according to Science Daily. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person, and the two types investigated were cognitive   empathy and affective   empathy. \"Every day people use empathy with, and without, their knowledge to get around in the social world,\" said Robert Eres from Monash University's School of Psychological Sciences. \"We use it for communication, to build relationships, and to increase our understanding of others.\" \"People who are high on affective empathy are often those who get quite fearful when watching a scary movie, or start crying during a sad scene. Those who have high cognitive empathy are those who are more rational, for example a psychologist helping someone,\" explained Eres. The results of the study showed that people with high scores for affective empathy had more gray matter in a part of the brain called the insula, found right in the \"middle\" of the brain. Those who scored higher for cognitive empathy had more in a part called the midcingulate cortex--an area above the corpus callosum, which connects the two halves of the brain. The discovery \"raises new questions--like whether people could train themselves to have more empathy, and whether those areas of the brain would become larger if they did, or whether we can lose our ability to empathize if we don't use it enough\", according to Science Daily. \"In the future we want to investigate further by testing whether training people in empathy-related tasks can lead to changes in these brain areas. We also want to investigate if damage to these brain areas, as a result of a stroke   for example, can lead to empathy problems.\" said Eres. Perhaps in the future we will all be able to empathize more with other people. Maybe you will cry at that sad movie after all! Which of the following statements might Robert Eres disagree with?", "subject": "social sciences", "choices": "[\"People use empathy when they are or aren't aware of it.\"\n 'People tend to use empathy to build relationships or understand others.'\n 'People with higher affective empathy feel heart-broken when watching sad movies.'\n 'People who are more rational have been found to have more gray matter in their brains.']", "answer": "3"}
{"question": "The Hunan Satellite TV (HNTV) show \"Where are we going, Dad?\" is a big hit. Many famous stars brought their children to a strange village alone, and they had to spend 72 hours with their children there. The program fully showed us a modern version of the \"how to be a good father\". As the young parents today are too busy to take care of their children, this new form of\"Lost on the way\"played by nanny   daddy and cute kids triggered a lot of people's emotional resonance . Both the kids and their parents will find that their hearts are being drawn closer. But this kind of feeling has just proved that there is a big spiritual barrier between the modern parents and children. The TV shows like \"Children are hard to support!\", \"Where are we going, Dad?\", \"hot mom\" and \"cute kids\" are becoming more and more popular. All of these show the new parents' confusion in children's education and the appeal for the balance between career and family. In real life, on the one hand, the young parents feel helpless because they are too busy to accompany their children under the pressures of work and life; on the other hand, they continue to do so. The data collected by HNTV show that nearly two-thirds of their audience are female, among whom 36% are aged from 25 to 34. We can imagine such a scene that one evening a young mother is watching the show with her young children, while her husband is still at work or trapped in socializing, or maybe is just playing computer games in the bedroom. The story of a child without the company of father is still going on. In fact, it is sometimes the same to mothers. In a modern family, it is often the old who take the responsibility for raising a child. The participation of mother in the children's education is also very low. It is just this kind of confusion where the parents have gone in the modern family education, and where the parents will guide their children to go that \"Where are we going, Dad?\" shows us. If a child wants to grow up healthily and safely into a modern citizen with independent personality and free spirit, it is very important for him or her to follow the parents who serve as their first teacher. Maybe this is the real reason why such kind of TV programs could get hot. The truth is that children will go where their parents go, and society will go where the children go. Which of the following can be inferred in the passage?", "subject": "social sciences", "choices": "[\"Parents shouldn't entirely leave the education of children to the old.\"\n '36% of the audience of the program are female aged from 25-34.'\n 'The program shows us the confusion where the parents and children will go to play.'\n 'In a modern family it is often mothers who are responsible for raising a child.']", "answer": "0"}

The project was an idea that came about after one of the Northeast students, Kalie Hoke, visited Haiti after the terrible 2010 earthquake and saw how difficult it was to find clean water. The students invented a portable , bicycle-powered emergency water filtration system, which can provide 20-30 people with drinking water in a 15-hour period.

About 400 members of the Eastern Hadza tribe live in Tanzania today, the only hunter-gatherers who remain in Africa. The Hadza hunt game, gather edible plants and honey, and move from place to place whenever the weather changers. Every two weeks or so, they move to a new campsite. At the Pinchoffs' campsite, three Hadza men stopped by to visit and ended up staying three days. One of the guides gave the men a cigarette. They took out the tobacco, put it in a pipe, and lit the pipe with fire they started. It takes less than two hours for Hadza women to build a new camp. They make huts by bending branches into round structures about six feet high, and then covering them with long, golden grass. If the weather is very wet, the women may choose a dry cave to set up a camp. Some rock caves have been used over thousands of years and are decorated with ancient rock paintings.

Rich and poor, young and old, one can see them all there, shouting for their teams. One of the most surprising things about football in England is the great knowledge of the game which even the smallest boy seems to have. He can tell you the names of the players in most of the important teams. He has pictures of them and knows the results of large numbers of matches. He will tell you who he thinks will win such a match, and his opinion is usually as good as that of men three or four times of his age. Most schools in England take football seriously -- much more seriously than nearly all European schools, where lessons are all very important and games are left for the children themselves. In England it is believed that education is not only a matter of filling a boy's mind with facts in the classroom; education also means the training of character by means of games, especially team games, where the boy or girl has to learn to work with others for his or her team instead of working for himself or herself alone. _ the school plans games and matches for its students.

Dr.Jason decided to make lire a little easier and a lot cheaper for his students by writing his own book on public speaking.\"Many books have an increased price because of CD-ROMs,lots of color photographs and pictures.I talked to my students,and many of them,like me,prefer to keep things simple!

{"question": "In some ways, the United States has made some progress. Fires no longer destroy 18,000 buildings as they did in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, or kill half a town of 2,400 people, as they did the same night in Peshtigo, Wisconsin. Other than the Beverly Hill Supper Club fire in Kentucky in 1977, it has been four decades since more than 100 Americans died in a fire. But even with such successes, the United States still has one of the worst fire death rates in the world. Safety experts say the problem is neither money nor technology, but the indifference  of a country that just will not take fires seriously enough. American fire departments are some of the world's fastest and best-equipped. They have to be. The United States has twice Japan's population, and 40 times as many fires. It spends far less on preventing fires than on fighting them. And American fire-safety lessons are aimed almost entirely at children, who die in large numbers in fires but who, against popular beliefs, start very few of them. Experts say the error is an opinion that fires are not really anyone's fault. That is not so in other countries, where both public education and the law treat fires as either a personal failing or a crime. Japan has many wood houses; of the 48 fires in world history that burned more than 10,000 buildings, Japan has had 27. Punishment for causing a big fire can be as severe as life imprisonment. In the United States, most education dollars are spent in elementary schools. But, the lessons are aimed at too limited a number of people; just 9 percent of all fire deaths are caused by children playing with matches. The United States continues to depend more on technology than laws or social pressure. There are smoke detectors in 85 percent of all homes. Some local building laws now require home sprinklers  .

{"question": "Inland waters may be grouped into two general classes: standing waters and flowing waters. As is often the case, the boundary between these two classes is not sharp and clear. A pond is an example of standing water. But most ponds are fed by springs or brooks and most have an outlet. Thus some current of changing water flows through them. On the other hand, a river is an example of flowing water. In some places, however, a river may have such a slow current that it is very difficult to detect. Standing inland waters differ in size, in age, and in many _ environmental characteristics. They range in size from roadside puddles to the Caspian Sea. Puddles may last for only a few days or weeks; ponds, for a few hundred to a thousand years. In general, lakes are older, though the waters of some tropical \"lakes\" disappear completely during each dry season. Standing waters vary from very shallow to very deep, from clear to muddy, from fresh to salty. In flowing waters we roughly distinguish between brooks, creeks, and rivers.

Suppose you see a middle-aged man fall to the side-walk. Is he having a heart attack? Is he in a coma   from diabetes ? Or is he about to sleep off a drunk? Is the smoke coming into the room from a leak in the air conditioning? Is it steam pipes? Or is it really smoke from a fire? It's not always easy to tell if you are faced with a real emergency. Second, and more important, the person faced with an emergency must feel personally responsible. He must feel that he must help, or the person won't get the help he needs. The researchers found that a lot depends on how many people are around. They had college students in to be tested. Some came alone. Some came with one or two others. And some came in large groups. The receptionist started them off on the tests. Then she went into the next room. A curtain divided the testing room and the room into which she went. Soon the students heard a scream, the noise of file cabinets falling and a cry for help. All of this had been pre-recorded on a tape-recorder. Eight out of ten of the students taking the test alone acted to help. Of the students in pairs, only two out of ten helped. Of the students in groups, none helped. In other words, in a group, Americans often fail to act. They feel that others will act. They, themselves, needn't. They do not feel any direct responsibility. Are people bothered by situations where people are in trouble? Yes. Scientists found that the people were emotional, they sweated, they had trembling hands. They felt the other person's trouble. But they did not act. They were in a group. Their actions were shaped by the actions of those they were with.

{"question": "I'm Rich Kleinfeldt with some financial expressions used in business and the stock market. Our first expression is \"in the red.\"  It is another way of saying that a business is losing money. In the past, numbers in the financial records of a company were written in red ink to show a loss.    A business magazine recently published a report about a television company. The report said the company was still in the red, but was able to cut its loss from the year before.    A profit by a business is written in black numbers. So a company that is \"in the black\" is making money.      Another financial expression is \"run on the bank.\" That is what happens when many people try to withdraw all their money from a bank. A \"run on the bank\" usually happens when people believe there is danger a bank may fail or close.    Newspaper reports about a banking crisis in Russia used that expression. They said the government acted because of fears that the crisis would cause a run on the banks.      \"Day trading\" is a system that lets investors trade directly on an electronic market system. It was the first completely computerized stock market. It sells stocks of companies not listed on any stock exchange. Many high technology companies are listed on it.    Day trading companies provide a desk and a computer system to an investor who wants to trade. Individuals must provide fifty thousand dollars or more to the trading company to pay for the stocks they buy. Thousands of other investors do day trading from computers in their homes. A day trader watches stock prices carefully. When he sees a stock rise in price, he uses the computer to buy shares of the stock. If the stock continues to rise in price in the next few minutes, the day trader sells the shares quickly to make a small profit. Then he looks for another stock to buy. If a stock goes down instead of up, he sells it and accepts the loss.    The idea is to make a small profit many times during the day. Day traders may buy and sell stocks hundreds of times each day.

{"question": "The new studies show that fewer than half of the 9th graders in many of the nation's largest cities, can ever graduate. _ And, in particular, the dropout rate isn't dropping for poor and minority students. Amazingly, though so many regret the rising dropout rate, our schools continue to lack formal plans--or any plans--to teach students motivation. Most schools have no game plan to ensure that students understand that schooling will be completely necessary. Schools expect youth and children to act as though schooling is important, but they never teach them to believe that. Years ago, families ensured that the children recognized the value of schooling. But in many modern families, the children may fail to recognize the importance of school life just because these families may actually tell their children that school is not important. Since many families are not motivating their children to be interested students, youth professionals, like teachers may need to provide this training. Here are some strategies to convince even the most apathetic   students that they must stay in school. Ask students if they will ever need to work: The world has changed. 100 years ago, factory work was the booming job, and it required no education. Today, factories are increasingly automated. Most computer-related jobs require education and at least a high school diploma. Ask students which century they will be prepared for: In 1900, the most common jobs were farm laborer and domestic servant--education not needed. Now, the most common jobs are office and sales staff--education and diploma usually needed. An amazing 6 out of 10 people today work in a store or office. Ask students to devise a way that the employee could be replaced. For example, the coming trend in fast food is to use computers rather than people to run the restaurant.

It is from these shoots that the best in got. Practically all the tea pickers are women. The estates like to employ women pickers because they are more careful. Their thin fingers can easily remove the twin leaves and new shoots from the plant, which are the parts used for processing tea. The pickers carry large baskets into which they throw their pickings. A skilled worker can harvest between 9 to 14 kilogrammes of tea leaves a day. Usually new shoots can be picked from the plants about every ten or fifteen days. Processing tea shoots into the familiar dry tea leaves requires great care and skill. There are various methods of processing depending on the type of tea required. For black tea, the young green leaves are first spread out on shelves to dry. This process removes much of its water and the leaves become soft. After this, the leaves are passed through heavy rollers. This operation will press the leaves for juices which give the tea both its colour and taste. Then the leaves are spread out on floors and left to ferment under wet conditions. Fermentation develops the rich taste of black tea. The fermented leaves are then dried with a hotair blower until they become rolledup black leaves.

{"question": "It would be pleasant to believe that all young girls in the past got married for romantic reasons; but the fact is that many of them regarded marriage as their only chance to gain independence from their parents, to have a provider, or to be assured of a good place in society. A couple of generations ago, an old maid of twenty-five did not have much to look forward to, she was more or less fated to remain with her parents or to live in some relative's home where she would help with the chores and the children. Not so any more. In the first place, women remain young much longer than they used to, and an unmarried woman of twenty-eight or thirty does not feel that her life is over. Besides, since she is probably working and supporting herself, she is free to marry only when and if she chooses. As a result, today's women tend  to marry later in life. They have fewer children-or none at all--if they prefer to devote themselves to their profession. The result is a decline in the birthrate. The new role that women have developed for themselves has changed family life. Children are raised differently; they spend more time with adults who are not their parents: baby sitters, day-care center personnel, relatives, or neighbors. Whether they gain or lose in the process is a hotly debated question. Some child experts believe that young children must spend all their time with their mother if they are to grow sound in body and mind. Others think that children get more from a mother who spends with them \"quality time\" (a time of fun and relaxation set aside for them) rather than hours of forced and unhappy baby sitting. And many child psychologists point out that children kept in day-care centers every day are brighter than those raised at home.

{"question": "What if our babies could somehow tell us what they're thinking about, what they want, and what makes them unhappy? Robyn Holt, researcher for Baby Talk New Zealand, says they can. Holt heard about baby sign language through an advertisement and decided to go along to a workshop  . \"Sign language is something that's always interested me, and I thought, it could be really cool to try this with a baby because we are always guessing all the time what they actually want.\" Holt started using baby sign language with her baby son Benjamin, now 12, and within two weeks he started to sign the sign for milk. She has since used it with her two younger sons Dominic, 8, and Matthew, 3. Baby sign language is nothing new: the practice (which is based on adult sign language) has been out in America for more than 30 years. But it is enjoying a rebirth in New Zealand. The idea behind baby sign language is that babies do have the ability to communicate their needs if they are given the right tools to do so. Although many mothers develop an intuition   about whether their baby's crying is from hunger, tiredness, or pain, baby sign language creates a direct form of communication that unlocks _ . When babies are between 6-months and 12 to 13-months, parents can begin to teach them sign language: use the sign for milk while feeding, and also talk about milk, so that the child begins to make the link   in their brain.

She joined the environmental protection association at her school. Now being president of a group of 25, she leads its efforts to help stray cats and dogs by raising money to buy them food and collecting old clothes to make them homes. However, sometimes the association raises doubts. Some students have questioned whether helping stray animals breaks the laws of nature. \"We tried to resolve the controversy,\" Yang said. \"For wild animals, the best way to protect them is to preserve their environment and their natural habitat, and to let them live their own way. However, for animals that depend heavily on humans, such as dogs and cats, the proper way to treat them is to respect them and take care of them.\" Besides, if not accommodated properly, stray animals can bring threats to public health, as they are the main cause of rabies in cities. \"Now, many young people in China have agreed upon the need to strike a balance between humans and nature.

How did these players get that way---was it through training and practice, or are great players \"born, not made\"? First, these players came from places that have had famous stars in the past---players that a young boy can look up to and try to imitate. In the history of soccer, only seven countries have ever won the World Cup---three from South America and four from Western Europe. There has never been a great national team---or a really great player---from North America or from Asia. Second, these players have all had years of practice in the game. Alfredo Di Stefano was the son of a soccer player, as was Pele. Most players begin playing the game at the age of three or four. Finally, many great players come from the same kind of neighborhood---a poor, crowded area where a boy's dream is not to be a doctor, lawyer, or businessman, but to become a rich, famous athlete or entertainer. For example, Liverpool, which produced the Beatles, had one of the best English soccer teams in recent years. Pele practiced in the street with a \"ball\" made of rags.

Those middle managers and financial analysts from state-owned enterprises and global companies were not untalented or without opinions, but they had been accustomed to an educational system that rarely rewarded critical thinking or Originality. Papers were often copied from the Internet and the Harvard Business Review. Students insisted that copying was a superior business strategy, better than inventing and creating.

{"question": "Ever walked to the shops only to find, once there, you've completely forgotten what you went for? Or struggled to remember the name of an old friend? For years we've accepted that a forgetful brain is as much a part of ageing as wrinkles and grey hair.But now a new book suggests that we've got it all wrong. According to The Secret Life of the Grown-up Brain, by science writer Barbara Strauch, when it comes to the important things, our brains actually get better with age.In fact, she argues that some studies have found that our brain hits its peak between our 40s and 60s--much later than previously thought. Furthermore, rather than losing many brain cells as we age, we retain them, and even produce new ones well into middle age.For years it's been assumed that brain, much like the body, declines with age.But the longest, largest study into what happens to people as they age suggests otherwise. This continuing research has followed 6,000 people since 1956, testing them every seven years.It has found that on average, participants performed better on cognitive  tests in their 40s and 50s than they had done in their 20s.Specifically, older people did better on tests of vocabulary, verbal memory (how many words you can remember) and problem solving. Where they performed less well was number ability and perceptual speed--how fast you can push a button when ordered.However, with more complex tasks such as problem-solving and language, we are at our best at middle age and beyond.In short, researchers are now coming up with scientific proof that we do get wiser with age. Neuroscientists are also finding that we are happier with ageing.A recent US study found older people were much better at controlling and balancing their emotions.It is thought that when we're younger we need to focus more on the negative aspects of life in order to learn about the possible dangers in the world, but as we get older we've learned our lessons and are sub-consciously aware that we have less time left in life: therefore, it becomes more important for us to be happy.

Education programs needed _ . \"We had no teaching resources suitable for English learners here before. We had to develop them all ourselves,\" a Texas principal said. Throughout the country, districts had to train their own teachers to teach English to non-native speakers or recruit  teachers from elsewhere.

But even as immigration has slowed or stopped in many places, and instructional programs for English-learners have matured, serving immigrant families and their children remains a work in progress in many public schools, especially those in communities that are skeptical, or sometimes unwelcoming, to the newcomers. One of the biggest challenges educators face, is communicating effectively with parents who don't speak English -- an issue that, in part, has contributed to recent complaints of discrimination by Latino students in some cities. \"The parents' role is very important for the success of these students, but it's also one of the most difficult things we've had to tackle ,\" said Jim D.

Greenland is the world's largest island, covering area more than three times the size of Texas. Some 81 percent of it is covered by ice, and there are many glaciers. Glaciers are like slow-moving rivers of ice. Where a glacier meets the sea, its weight keeps it firmly resting on the bottom.

Other surveys have similarly found a significant gap between the age workers expect to retire and when they actually leave their jobs.A 2014 Employee Benefit Research Institute survey found that 33 percent of workers expect to retire after age 65, but only 16 percent of retirees report staying on the job that long.Just 9 percent of workers say they are planning to retire before age 60, but 35 percent of retirees say they retired that early.The average retirement age in the survey was 62. Many of these early retirements are unexpected and due to unforeseen circumstances.About half (49 percent) of retirees say they left the workforce earlier than planned, often as a result of a health problem or disability (61 percent) or to care for a family member (18 percent), EBRI found.Other retirees are forced out of their jobs due to changes at their company, such as a downsizing   or closing (18 percent), changes in the skills required for their job (7 percent) or other work-related reasons (22 percent). \"The difference is between what you know you want to do and what factors   outside your control ultimately require you to do,\" says Dallas Salisbury, president of EBRI.

{"question": "Plastics are considered one of the most serious pollutants causing environmental problems. The garbage containing plastics end up in the waterways that eventually flow into the oceans. Accumulation  of plastic in the ocean endangers marine life and pollutes the water. Does a plastic continent exist? Yes, a plastic continent does exist and was discovered by Captain Charles Moore a decade ago. The plastic continent is twice the size of Britain and it is the region between the Hawaii Islands and California in the central Pacific Ocean. One of the causes of the lack of marine life in this region is due to pollution and pollutants are none other than plastics. Captain Charles Moore believes plastic waste started accumulating in the 1950s. The plastic continent is the man-made continent of floating plastic waste. The fisher men and the sailors have avoided this region for years. The reasons are: 1. There are no fish here because of the lack of nutrients. 2. The zone also lacks the wind that is essential for sailing. To do research on the ocean pollution, Captain Moore founded Algalita Marine Research Foundation. Other organizations such as Greenpeace supported his cause. The reports of The United Nations Environment Program show that millions of seabirds and marine animals are dying due to the invasion of plastics. The waste plastics can be recycled, but in fact they are being thrown into the oceans. The marine animals mistake these for food and eat them. This leads to their death that affects the marine food chain. To save the oceans from the plastic continent you need to reduce the use of plastics, reuse plastic bags and recycle plastics.

{"question": "People do not analyze every problem they meet. Sometimes they try to remember a solution from the last time they had a similar problem. They often accept the opinions or ideas of other people. Other times they begin to act without thinking. They try to find a solution by trial and error. However, when all these methods fail, the person with a problem has to start analyzing. There are six stages in analyzing a problem. First the person must recognize that there is a problem. For example, Sam's bicycle is broken, and he cannot read it to class as he usually does. Sam must see that there is a problem with his bicycle. Next the thinker must define the problem. Before Sam can repair his bicycle, he must find out the reason why it does not work. For instance, he must determine if the problem is with the gears, the brakes, or the frame. He must make his problem more specific. Now the person must look for information that will make the problem clearer and lead to possible solutions. For instance, suppose Sam decided that his bike does not work because there is something wrong with the gear wheels. At this time, he can look in his bicycle repair book and read about gears. He can talk to his friends at the bike shop. He can look at his gears carefully. After studying the problem, the person should have several suggestions for a possible solution. Take Sam as an illustration. His suggestions might be: put oil on the gear wheels; buy new gear wheels and replace the old ones; tighten or loosen the gear wheels. Eventually one suggestion seems to be the solution to the problem. Sometimes the final idea comes very suddenly because the thinker suddenly sees something new or sees something in a new way. Sam, for example, suddenly sees that there is a piece of chewing gum between the gear wheels. He immediately realizes the solution to his problem: he must clean the gear wheels. Finally the solution is tested. Sam cleans the gear wheels and finds that afterwards his bicycle works perfectly. he has solved the problem.

{"question": "Amusement parks make most of their money from admission fees paid by guests attending the park. Other sources include parking fees, food and drink sales and souvenirs. Practically all amusement parks operate using one of two admission principles:         Pay-as-you-go In this form, a guest enters the park at little or no charge. The guest must then buy rides one by one, either at the attraction's entrance or by buying ride tickets. The cost of the attraction is often based on its complexity   or popularity. The park may allow guests to buy unlimited admissions to all attractions within the park. A pass is then shown at the attraction entrance to gain admission.        Disneyland opened in 1955 using the pay-as-you-go form. Initially, guests paid the ride admission fees at the attractions. Soon, the problems of dealing with so many coins led to the development of a ticket system that, while now out of use, is still part of the amusement-park vocabulary. In this new form, guests bought ticket books that contained a number of tickets, with \"A,\" \"B\" and \"C.\" Rides and attractions using an \"A-ticket\" were generally simple, with \"B-tickets\" and \"C-tickets\" used for the larger, more popular rides. Later, the \"D-ticket\" was added, then finally the now-famous \"E-ticket,\" which was used for the biggest rides, like Space Mountain. Smaller tickets could be traded up for use on larger rides. Disneyland, as well as the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, gave up this practice in 1982.

{"question": "Why are newspapers and TV broadcasts filled with disaster, corruption and incompetence? It may be because we're drawn to depressing stories without realizing, according to psychologists. When you read the news, sometimes it can feel like the only things reported are terrible, depressing events. Why do the media concentrate on the bad things in life, rather than the good? In fact, many people often say that they would prefer good news. The researchers present their experiment as solid evidence of a so called \"negativity bias \", psychologists' term for our collective hunger to hear, and remember bad news. It isn't just delight in other people's misfortune, the theory goes, but that we've evolved to react quickly to potential threats. Bad news could be a signal that we need to change what we're doing to avoid danger. As you'd expect from this theory, there's some evidence that people respond quicker to negative words. In lab experiments, flash the word \"cancer\", \"bomb\" or \"war\" up at someone and they can hit a button in response quicker than if that word is \"baby\", \"smile\" or \"fun\". We are also able to recognize negative words faster than positive words, and even tell that a word is going to be unpleasant before we can tell exactly what the word is going to be. There's another interpretation  that researchers put on their evidence: we pay attention to bad news, because on the whole, we think the world is more hopeful than it actually is. When it comes to our own lives, most of us believe we're better than average, and that, like the cliches, we expect things to be all right in the end. This pleasant view of the world makes bad news all the more surprising and arresting. It is only against a light background that the dark spots are highlighted.

While I was gone, they had to make important decisions on a number of data center projects. They analyzed the options, and determined the proper course of action.

The purpose for English learning and the situations in which such learning takes place are so varied that it is difficult to explain and still more difficult to judge what forms an adequate working knowledge for each situation. The main reason for the widespread demand for English is its present-day importance as a world language. Besides serving the indefinite needs of its native speakers, English is a language in which some of important works in science, technology, and other fields are being produced, and not always by native speakers. It is widely used for such purposes as meteorological  and airport communications, international conferences, and the spread of information over the radio and television networks of many nations. It is a language of wider communication for a number of developing countries, especially former British colonies.

{"question": "Thousands of teenagers will be able to move to a new wave of \"studio schools\" at the age of 14 to improve their chances of finding a job in UK. Twelve new-style schools are open to act as a bridge to the workplace and cut the number of NEETs. Under plans, schools will operate longer days and work outside standard school terms. Each teenager will be expected to spend between four hours and two days a week on work placements with business related to the school and a personal coach will be sent to the teenagers to act as a school \"line manager\". The reforms   are put forward because of the fears that too many teenagers are finishing full-time education at present but they are short of the skills needed to succeed in the workplace. According to a recent report, more than two thirds of employers   believe school and college leavers have less important employability skills, while 55% say they are unable to manage their time or daily routine. And the number of NEETs who are not in education has hit a record high, with almost one-in-five young people being left without a job or a training place. The Department for Education will tell the public the building of 12 studio schools - providing for around 3,600 teenagers - in areas such as Liverpool, Stevenage, Stock-on-Trent and Fulham, west London. Each one will be connected to the local employers. Under plans, teenagers will be able to move out of ordinary schools to attend them between the ages of 14 and 19. The government said all subjects would be taught \"through projects, often prepared with employers\" - with rules such as science being connected directly to local engineering companies or hospitals. Schools will operate a longer day to give teenagers a better understanding of the needs of the workplace. Along with their studies, students will carry out work placements for four hours a week, rising to two days a week of paid work for those aged 16 to 19.

She was also 18 and enrolled in a course in physics. \"Your major is of no use to society. What will you do with it when you graduate, other than teach? Plus, you're going to be poor your whole life,\" she said. \"You have no soul and your degree is boring. I don't care how much money you're going to earn. I'd rather be poor and don't mind being a teacher. If I love my work I'll have something far more meaningful than a big bank account!\" came the reply. And so it went, back and forth, neither of us giving the other an inch, each of us stubbornly committed to our prejudice. We were both ignorant, but our ignorance was also society's ignorance. It had always been that way. Scientists mocked  humanists; humanists laughed at scientists. Back in the 1960s, the physicist-turned novelist C. P. Snow labeled the sciences-humanities divide \"a problem of 'the two cultures'\" . He said it was bad for society. The modern world needed well-rounded people. I think I know better now, but it would have helped if we had been encouraged to think a little more outside our science and arts \"boxes\". That's why I believe it is healthy that China is beginning a debate on whether it's wise for young people to have to choose which direction their careers - and lives - will take at such an early age. At the moment, in their second year of high school, students must choose either the sciences or the humanities. After making the choice, they focus their energies on passing the appropriate college entrance exam. But now, people in China are asking: Is this forced, early decision good for young people or society? Young people need time to explore, to discover where their real talents and interests lie. There are more than just a few middle-aged people out there, stuck in jobs they hate because they made the wrong choice at the wrong time. And from the point of view of society, isn't it better for students to delay a while before they decide what to study? Scientists can benefit from learning to develop the critical skills associated with the humanities; students in the humanities, surely, only stand to gain by finding out a little more about science and technology, which are so important to the future of a developing country like China. With any luck, in the future young people fresh to college will be better informed about the possibilities of education than people of my generation.

It's hardly surprising that America has one of the highest gun related murder rates of all countries!

{"question": "We Chat, the Chinese social media smartphone app, saw an increase in user numbers of 41 per cent year on year to 500m at the end of 2014, in a sign that parent company Tencent is extending  its reach for the mobile internet. Revenue grew 24 per cent to Rmb20.98billion, slightly higher than forecasts, driven mainly by online gaming revenues. It is unclear how much WeChat contributed to Tencent's revenues but the app's growth is a strong indicator of the company's long-term health as it tries to adjust its business to be more suitable for mobile devices. \"We extended our leadership in games and online media, and made breakthroughs in emerging platforms such as online security . . . and mobile payments,\" Ma Huateng, Tencent chairman, said in a statement. WeChat is the second highest ranked app in China, behind QQ, Tencent's other chatting app, which claimed to have 815m registered monthly users at the end of 2014. However, that figure is more than the total number of internet users in China, which the government puts at 640million. Tencent has been unwilling to earn money through WeChat by flooding it with advertising, which could reduce efforts to increase the user base. But this is expected to change. Some analysts predicted that advertising would be introduced on later this year. Early attempts to test ads on the service have not always gone smoothly. After a BMW ad was introduced on some users' feeds in January, many users complained of \"discrimination\" by Tencent's data mining algorithm.

{"question": "Digital technology -- email and smart phones especially -- have vastly improved workers' ability to be productive outside of a traditional office. Even so, most white-collar work still happens in an office. One reason is that, according to findings of a new survey   of office workers conducted by Wakefield Research for the IT company Citrix, most bosses are doubtful about remote working. Half of the workers say their boss doesn't accept it and only 35 percent say it's tolerated. Skeptical bosses will likely have their doubts reinforced   by the same survey, which shows that 43 percent of workers say they've watched TV or a movie while \"working\" remotely, while 35 percent have done housework,and 28 percent have cooked dinner. It is true, however,that working at home makes people much more efficient  , because it allows workers to take care of annoying housework while still getting their jobs done. It's much faster, for example, to shop for groceries at a quarter to three than to stand in line during the after-work rush. The fact that such practices remain officially unaccepted reflects how far we haven't come as a society from the days when we expected every full-time worker to be supported by a full-time homemaker. More broadly the Wakefield survey suggests that employers may be missing a low-cost way to give workers something of value. Sixty-four percent of those survey participants who have worked remotely would rather give up some bonus in order to get even one day a week working from home. Under such circumstances, smart firms need to find ways to let their employees have enough flexibility to manage their time efficiently.

It is the case that somebody who is in the upper third of income, poor scores, in the bottom on tests when they are in eighth grade, is more likely to go to college and finish college than a poor kid with the top scores. That's what the working persons'  children are up against. The Economic Policy Institute finds it would take a poor couple with 2 children 9 or 10 generations to achieve middle class status.

{"question": "Decisions, decisions! Our lives are full of them, from the small ones to the life-changing. The right to choose is central to everyone. Yet sometimes we make bad decisions that leave us unhappy or full of regret. Can science help? Most of us know little about the mental processes that lie behind our decisions. Luckily, what psychologists are finding may help us all make better choices. Here are some of their amazing discoveries to help you make up your mind. Consider your emotions. You might think that emotions are the enemy of decision making, but in fact they're a part of it. Whenever you make up your mind, your brain's emotional center is active. University of Southern California scientist, Antonio Damasio, has studied people with damage to only the emotional parts of their brains, and found that they were unable to make basic choices about what to wear or eat. Damasio thinks this may be because our brains store emotional memories of past choices, which we use to help the present decision making. However, making choices under the influence of an emotion can greatly affect the result. Take anger, for example. A study by Nitika Garg of the University of Mississippi and other scientists found the angry shoppers were more likely to choose the first thing they were offered rather than considering other choices. It seems anger can lead us to make quick decisions without much thinking. All emotions affect our thinking and motivation , so it may be best to avoid making important decisions under their influence. Yet strangely there's one emotion that seems to help us make good choices. The American researchers found that sad people took time to consider the various choices on offer, and ended up making the best choices. In fact many studies show that people who feel unhappy have the most reasonable view of the world.

Each year, the group of students completed a survey indicating whether they had dated and reported the frequency of different behaviors, including the use of drugs and alcohol. Their teachers completed questionnaires about the students' academic efforts. He found some students never or hardly ever reported dating from middle to high school, and these students had consistently the best study skills according to their teachers. Other students dated infrequently in middle school but increased the frequency of dating in high school. \"At all points in time, teachers rated the students who reported the lowest frequency of dating as having the best study skills and the students with the highest dating as having the worst study skills,\" according to the journal article. Study skills refer to behaviors that lead to academic success such as doing work for extra credit being well organized, finishing homework, working hard and reading assigned chapters. \"Dating a classmate may have the same emotional complications of dating a co-worker,\" Orpinas said, \"When the couple break up, they have to continue to see each other in class and perhaps witness the ex-partner dating someone else.

{"question": "Most employers say that they wish to employ the right person for the right job. A recent report by Britain's Independent Institute of Manpower Studies, however, disagrees with this. The report states that most employers wish to avoid employing the wrong person. Rather than looking for the right person, they are looking for applicants to turn down. The report also suggests that in Britain and in many other parts of the world the selection methods used to pick out the right person for the job certainly do not match up to those used to judge a piece of new equipment. Employers used three main selection methods: interviewing, checking resume or application forms and examining references. Most of the employers asked in this survey stated that these selection methods were used more for weeding out unsuitable applicants rather than for finding suitable ones. Interviews were considered to be more reliable than either resume checks or references from past employers. Research, however, proves otherwise. Interviewers' decisions are often strongly influenced by their earlier judgment of the written application. Also different employers view facts differently. One may consider applicants who have frequently changed jobs as people with broad and useful experience. Another will see such applicants as unreliable and unlikely to stay for long in the new job. Some employers place great importance on academic qualifications whereas the link between this and success in management is not necessarily strong. Some employers use handwriting as a standard. The report states that there is little evidence to support the value of the letter for judging working ability. References, also, are sometimes unreliable as they are not very important while checks on credit and security records and applicants' political opinions are often the opposite. The report is more favorable towards trainability tests and those which test personality and personal and mental skills.

{"question": "During the school year many parents take on the role of driver as they drive their children from one lesson to another .Understandably so. Many of us want our children to have a little taste of everything, from organized sports to music, dance and more. But we can overdo it, leaving our children feeling a little burnt out, and according to parent educator Diane Loisie ,it's their school work which suffers the most. \"After school, if they're busy in a number of sporting events, besides they need to do their homework, then the time they'll feel sleepy is in the classroom. Your child needs free time. So if you're filling up that after school time, then it's during the day that they're going to be taking a break.\" Professor Claire McDermott agrees that there's a lot to be gained from sometimes putting those scheduled lessons and activities away. \"Relaxing time is important for children. It's time just to do the things they want to do. A child can go up to their room, or they can play around. It doesn't look like productive time; parents certainly wouldn't be saying 'Wow, are they ever learning things now?' But this relaxing time gives both the body and the brain just a wonderful chance to relax after a day. It helps a child prepare for sleep, but it also helps to understand the learning that's gone on that day.\" It's hard to prevent signing our kids up for some activities and lessons. After all, many of us want our children to have a head start in life and the chance to join in great activities in the arts or sports is a part of that. However, Loisie feels that in the long run most children feel better with just a few key activities because it gives them an opportunity to master them. \"When we get our children in too many activities because we want our children to experience everything, then what we're doing is setting them up not to be good at one thing or gaining a skill.\" So choose your children's activities wisely.

{"question": "For years, there has been a bias   against science among clinical psychologists  . In a two-year analysis to be published in November inPerspectives on Psychological Science, psychologists led by Timothy B. Baker of the University of Wisconsin charge that many clinical psychologists fail to \"provide the treatments for which there is the strongest evidence of effectiveness\" and \"give more weight to their personal experiences than to science.\" As a result, patients have no guarantee that their \"treatment will be informed by ... science.\" Walter Mischel of Columbia University is even crueler in his judgment. \"The disconnect between what clinical psychologists do and what science has discovered is an extreme embarrassment,\" he told me, and \"there is a widening gap between clinical practice and science.\" The \"widening\" reflects the great progress that psychological research has made in identifying   the most effective treatments. Thanks to strict clinical trials, we now know that teaching patients to think about their thoughts in new, healthier ways and to act on those new ways of thinking are effective against depression, panic disorder and other problems, with multiple trials showing that these treatments -- the tools of psychology -- bring more lasting benefits than drugs. You wouldn't know this if you sought help from a typical clinical psychologist. Although many treatments are effective, relatively few psychologists learn or practice them. Why in the world not? For one thing, says Baker, clinical psychologists are \"very doubtful about the role of science\" and \"lack solid science training\". Also, one third of patients get better no matter what treatment (if any) they have, \"and psychologists remember these successes, believing, wrongly, that they are the result of the treatment.\" When faced with evidence that treatments they offer are not supported by science, clinical psychologists argue that they know better than some study what works. A 2008 study of 591 psychologists in private practice found that they rely more on their own and colleagues' experience than on science when deciding how to treat a patient. If they keep on this path as insurance companies demand evidence-based medicine, warns Mischel, psychology will \"discredit itself.\" Many clinical psychologists fail to provide the most effective treatments because   _  .", "subject": "social sciences", "choices": "['they are unfamiliar with their patients'\n 'they believe in science and evidence'\n \"they depend on their colleagues' help\"\n 'they rely on their personal experiences']", "answer": "3"}

{"question": "A firm handshake is key to interview success. As any serious job-hunter knows, it helps to dress smartly and smile at that all-important interview. But research has showed that a firm handshake is what really matters when it comes to impressing potential employers. The US research looked at 98 undergraduates taking part in mock   interviews with businesses. As each undergraduate was graded on their overall performance, five \"handshake raters\" also marked them on their grasp, strength, duration, vigor and eye contact. Professor Greg Stewart, from the University of Iowa, who led the study, said those who scored highly with the handshake raters were also considered to be the most hirable by the interviewers. Students with \" wimpy\" shakes were judged to be more timid and less impressive. The study also found women with a firm handshake were likely to be evaluated more favorably than their male counterparts. Professor Stewart said: \"We've always heard that interviewers make up their mind about a person in the first two or three minutes of an interview. But we found that the first impression begins with a handshake that sets the tone for the rest of the interview. We don't consciously remember a person's handshake but it is one of the first non-verbal clues we get about the person's overall personality, and that impression is what we remember.\" Women were less likely to have a highly rated handshake, partly because traditionally they shake hands less than men. But when women did possess a firm handshake, they were likely to be evaluated more favorably than their male counterparts. Body language experts warn, however, that the firmness needs to be just right, - as an over enthusiastic \"bone crusher\" handshake can indicate self-importance, a controlling personality and a lack of trustworthiness. The handshake is thought to have originated in medieval Europe as a way for kings and knights to show that they did not intend to harm each other and possessed no hidden weapons.

In England it is believed that education is not only a matter filling a boy's mind with facts in the classroom: education also means the training of character; and one of the best ways of training character is by means of games, especially team games; where a boy or girl has to learn to work with others for his or her team, instead of working for oneself alone. The school therefore plans games and matches for its students. Football is a good team game. It is good both for the body and the mind. That's why it is every school's game in England.

Mom had also prepared a keyboard for me,since she knew that I played the piano. My life in the family did not go so well at first. Because I am the only child in my family in China,I was not used to having two younger kids -- Zachary and Grace--running around me yelling   all the time.

{"question": "Hi, everybody. Over the past couple months, most of the political headlines you've read have probably been about the government shutdown and the launch of the Affordable Care Act . And I know that many of you have rightly never been more frustrated with Washington. But if you look beyond those headlines, there are some good things happening in our economy. And that's been my top priority since the day I walked into the Oval Office. After decades in which the middle class was working harder and harder just to keep up, and a punishing recession that made it worse, we made the tough choices required not just to recover from crisis, but to rebuild on a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. Five years later, we have fought our way back. Our businesses have created 7.8 million new jobs in the past 44 months. Another 200,000 Americans went back to work last month. The American auto industry has come back with more than 350,000 new jobs --- jobs putting out and selling the high-tech, fuel-efficient cars the world wants to buy. And they're leading the charge in a business that has added jobs for the first time since the 1990s --- a big reason why our businesses sell more goods and services \"Made in America\" than ever before. We decided to stop our addiction to foreign oil. And today, we produce more renewable energy than ever, more natural gas than anybody, and for the first time in nearly 20 years, America now produces more oil than we buy from other countries. We decided to fix a broken health care system. And even though the task has been rough, so far, about 500,000 Americans gain health coverage starting January 1st. And by the way, health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And one more thing: since I took office, we've cut our deficits   by more than half. And that makes it easier to invest in the things that create jobs --- education, research, and so on. Imagine how much farther along we could be if both parties were working together. Think about what we could do if the few didn't hold the economy hostage   every few months, or waste time on dozens of votes to _ the Affordable Care Act rather than try to help us fix it. In the weeks ahead, I'll keep talking about my plan to build a better bargain for the middle class. Good jobs. A good education. A chance to buy a home, save, and retire. And yes, the financial security of affordable health care. And I'll look for any willing partners who want to help. Because of your hard work and tough sacrifices over the past five years, we're pointed in the right direction. But we've got more work to do to keep moving that way. And as long as I'm President, I'll keep doing everything I can to create jobs, grow the economy, and make sure that everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead. Thanks, and have a great weekend.

It's also good to get along with your teacher because, in general, it's smart to learn how to relate to the different types of people you'll meet throughout your life.  But really, there's one super-important reason why you should get along with your teacher. When you do, \"learning bursts right open,\" says Evelyn Vuko, a longtime teacher who writes an education column called \"Teacher Says\" for the Washington Post newspaper.  In fact, kids who get along with their teachers not only learn more, but they're also more comfortable asking questions and getting extra help. This makes it easier to understand new material and do the best on tests. When you have this kind of relationship with a teacher, he or she can be someone to turn to when you have problems, such as problems with learning, school issues, or bullying. As a kid in elementary or middle school, you're at a wonderful stage in your life. You're like a sponge , able to take in lots of new and exciting information. On top of that, you're able to think about all this information in new ways. Remember teachers are people too, and they feel great if you're open to what they're teaching you. That's why they wanted to be teachers in the first place--to teach! In every school, kids will say certain teachers are tough. In fact, in most cases, your teacher wants to help you.

{"question": "When something goes wrong,it can be very satisfying to say,\"Well,it's so-and-so's fault.\"or \"I know I'm late,but it's not my fault;the car broke down.\"It is probably not your fault,but once you form the habit of blaming somebody or something else for a bad situation,you are a loser. You have no power and could do nothing that helps change the situation. However,you can have great power over what happens to you if you stop focusing on whom to blame and start focusing on how to  _ the situation. This is the winner's key to success. Winners are great at overcoming problems. For example, if you were late because your car broke down, maybe you  need to have your car examined more regularly. Or, you might start to carry along with you the useful phone numbers, so you could call for help when in need. For another example, if your colleague causes you problems on the job for lack of responsibility or ability, find ways of dealing with his irresponsibility or inability rather than simply blame  the person. Ask to work with a different person, or don't rely on this person. You should accept that the person is not reliable and find creative ways to work successfully regardless of how your colleague fails  to do his job well. This is what being a winner is all about--creatively using your skills and talents so that you are successful no matter what happens. Winners don't have fewer problems in their lives; they have just as many difficult situations to face as anybody else. They are just better at seeing those problems as challenges and opportunities to develop their own talents.

{"question": "Taking photographs at a birthday or a wedding has become as natural as blowing out candles or cutting the cake. But our obsession with recording every detail of our happiest moments could be damaging our ability to remember _ , according to new research. A study has shown that taking pictures rather than concentrating fully on the events in front of us prevents memories taking hold. Dr. Linda Henkel, from Fairfield University, Connecticut, described it as the \"photo-taking impairment effect\". She said: \"People so often pull out their cameras almost mindlessly to capture a moment, to the point where they are missing what is happening right in front of them. When people rely on technology to remember for them--counting on the camera to record the event and thus not needing to attend to it fully themselves--it can have a negative impact on how well they remember their experiences.\" Dr Henkel and her team carried out an experiment in a museum, to learn if taking pictures of the exhibits was hindering the ability of visitors to remember what they had seen. A group of university students were led on a tour at the Bellarmine Museum of Art at Fairfield University and were asked to either photograph or try and remember objects on display. The next day their memory was tested. The results showed that people were less accurate in recognizing the objects they had photographed than those they had only looked at. It was found that their memory for the details of the objects they had photographed was poorer. Henkel's lab is currently investigating whether the content of a photo, such as whether you are in it, affects later memory. She is also researching whether actively choosing what to photograph might influence what we remember. Previous research suggests that reviewing photos we have taken does help us remember the objects, but only if we take the time. \"Research has suggested that the sheer volume and lack of organization of digital photos for personal memories discourages many people from accessing and recalling them. In order to remember, we have to access and interact with the photos, rather than just collect them,\" said Dr Henkel.

{"question": "Every day Yang Hongwei takes the bus home from work, staring silently at the European-style villas , luxury cars and twinkling lights from the shopping center that he sees through the window. Yang works for a software company in Zhongguancun. He dreams of such a life, away from poverty, and that hope has kept him in Beijing for three years since he graduated from university. Soon Yang squeezes his way off the bus to the reality of his life: his home--a 10-square-metre room that costs 550 yuan(81 US dollars) or about one-fifth of his salary in rent every month. It's very cold inside the house as it has no central heating system. He has to stand the long and cold winter. Determined to achieve his dream, Yang says he has changed jobs \"numerous\" times in the past three years and is considering quitting his present job. Yang's frustration over his life as a migrant  is shared by many other graduates that have moved into big cities. Together they have come to be called the \"ant tribe\", a term created by Chinese sociologists to describe the struggles of young migrants, who, armed with their diplomas, flood to big cities in hopes of a better life only to put up with low-paying jobs and poor living conditions. They share every similarity with ants. They live in colonies in crowded areas. They're intelligent and hardworking, yet unknown and underpaid. The term, sociologists have said, also reflects their helplessness in a world governed by the law of the concrete jungle--only the strongest survive. A survey in Ant TribeII found nearly 30 percent of the \"ants\" are graduates of famous key universities--almost three times the percentage of 2009. Most have degrees in popular majors, such as medicine, engineering, economics and management. In addition, 7.2 percent of the \"ants\" have at least a master's degree compared to 1.6 percent in 2009. Most said the economic recovery did not really improve their financial situations, and 66 percent said their incomes fell short of their expectations, the survey also found. For two years, Lian Si, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Chinese and Global Affairs of Peking University, who has studied the phenomenon, led a team of more than 100 graduate students to follow the groups in university towns like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Xi'an. Lian evaluates the total population of the \"ant community\" in major cities at one million across China, with about 100,000 found in Beijing alone. Lian predicts that an increasingly challenging job market will see the ant tribe growing further in number. Another 6.3 million graduates are expected to join migrant workers and other job hunters in what promises to be a fierce labour competition. The ant tribe's embarrassing living situations have become a serious social issue, and the government should develop \"second-and-third-tier cities\" to attract more graduates from big cities. However, \"ants\" expect more study and training opportunities in big cities, which keeps them in positive mindsets despite their situations. As in the case of Yang, he is optimistic about getting a new job soon, having received eight interview offers in a week after sending out his resume. The prospect of landing a higher-paying job keeps him hopeful of moving out of the slum district  soon. The sooner the better. .

De Blasio, _ a promise made during his 2013 mayoral campaign, said students would also have a day off on the Lunar New Year, and not long ago the Asian holiday took place on February 8, 2016. \"About 15% of the city's school system is of Asian descent , and many student, have been taking the day off as a sick day\" said State Senator Daniel Squadron. \"It's a big deal,\" he said, whose district includes Manhattan's Chinatown. \"Families have had to choose between their most important cultural celebration and missing a day of school.\" The city's Department of Education had been working on the practical arrangements for adding another holiday while maintaining the legal 180 school days. The problem was solved by combining two half days that previously did not count towards the total to form a single full day that can be counted towards the total.

{"question": "What does the word iceberg make you think of ? Do you think of a large block of ice in a cold northern ocean? Or do you think of something that ships can crash into? While these are both correct, in truth there's far more to icebergs than meets the eye. According to scientists, only the largest blocks of ice count as icebergs. They must rise at least 5 meters above the water and be 15 meters wide at the water line. But only about 10 percent of an iceberg can be seen. The rest lie beneath the water. Icebergs begin froming when layers of snow fall year after year without melting. The snow is pressed together into large blocks of ice called glaciers. When chunks of ice break off these glaciers, icebergs are born. In Greenland alone, about 40,000 icebergs are formed each year. Since they began as snow, icebergs are made of fresh water, not salty ocean water. Tidy bubbles of air inside the ice give them their white color1. While most icebergs are white, some are blue because they have melted and frozen again. This action allows the air bubbles to escape. Other icebergs have brown, black or yellow parts because of dirt mixed with the ice. Algae   can also get trapped in the underwater parts of an iceberg. If the iceberg turns over, all or part of it is green! Icebergs can be flat, cube-shaped, round like a turtle shell or U-shaped. Some even look like mountains. The large underwater parts of icebergs are hard for ships to avoid. They have destroyed and sunk many ships, including the Titanic. As a result, the International Ice Patrol now monitors icebergs in areas with heavy ship traffic. But there's yet another side to icebergs. Many microscopic   animals live inside icebergs and in the water around them. These creatures feed on minerals that the icebergs store and release as they melt.

{"question": "It is difficult to imagine what life will be like without memory. The meanings of thousands of everyday perceptions(, ), the bases for the decisions we make, and the roots of our habits and skills are to be found in our past experiences, which are brought into the present by memory.    Memory can be defined as the capacity to keep information available for later use. It includes not only \"remembering\" things like arithmetic or historical facts, but also involves any change in the way an animal typically behaves. Memory is involved when a rat gives up eating grain because he has sniffed something suspicious in the grain pile. Memory is also involved when a six-year-old child learns to swing a baseball bat.    Memory exists not only in humans and animals but also in some physical objects and machines. Computers, for example, contain devices from storing data for later use. It is interesting to compare the memory-storage capacity of a computer with that of a human being. The instant-access memory of a large computer may hold up to 100,000 \"words\"--ready for instant use. An average prefix = st1 /U.

On January 13th leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN) signed an agreement to help migrant  workers--with the realization that the flow of labour between their countries is a growing problem that they cannot blame on outsiders.A 2005 study showed that 8.4 million Southeast Asians worked outside their home countries,but this did not include the huge numbers of Indonesians doing so without papers.So the true total is probably rather higher.

{"question": "Biologists believe that love is fundamentally a biological rather than a cultural construct, because the capacity for love is found in all human cultures and similar behavior is found in some other animals. In humans the purpose of all the desire is to focus attention on the raising of offspring. Children demand an unusual amount of parenting, and two parents are better than one. Love is a signal that both partners are committed, and makes it more likely that this commitment will continue as long as necessary for children to reach independence. But what does science have to say about the notion of love at first sight? In recent years the ability to watch the brain in action has offered a wealth of insight into the mechanics of love. Researchers have shown that when a person falls in love, a dozen different part of brain work together to release chemicals that trigger feelings of euphoria, bonding and excitement. It has also been shown that the unconditional love between a mother and a child is associated with activity in different regions of the brain from those associated with pair-bonding love. Passionate love is rooted in the reward circuitry of the brain--the same area that is active when humans feel a rush from cocaine. In fact, the desire, motivations and withdrawals involved in love have a great deal in common with addiction. Its most intense forms tend to be associated with the early stages of a relationship, which then give way to a calmer attachment form of love one feels with a long term partner. What all this means is that one special person can become chemically rewarding to the brain of another. Love at first sight, then, is only possible if the mechanism for generating long-term attachment can be triggered quickly. There are signs that it can be. One line of evidence is that people are able to decide within a second how attractive they find another person. This decision appears to be related to facial attractiveness, although men may favor women with waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7, no matter what their overall weight is. (This ratio may indicate a woman's reproductive health.) Another piece of evidence comes from work by a psychologist at Ben-Gurion University, who found in a survey that a small percentage (11%) of people in long-term relationships said that they began with love at first sight. In other words, in some couples the initial favorable impressions of attractiveness triggered love which sustained a lengthy bond. It is also clear that some couples need to form their bonds over a longer period, and popular culture tells many tales of friends who become lovers. One might also assume that if a person is looking for a partner with _ that cannot be quantified instantly, such as compassion, intellect or a good sense of humor, then it would be hard to form a relationship on the basis of love at first sight. Those more concerned with visual appearances, though, might find this easier. So it appears that love at first sight exists, but is not a very common basis for long-term relationships.

{"question": "When people reunite with their loved ones, it's usually all extremely happy moment. But what is their most common response to seeing them again? It may seem strange,but most of the time they break down in tears. Now a group of psychologists from Yale University say they have found the reason why, and that crying tears of joy may well be the body's way of keeping emotional balance. \"They seem to take place when people are overtaken by strong positive emotions, and people who do this seem to recover better from those strong emotions,\" Oriana Aragon, the lead researcher said. Aragon and her fellow psychologists looked at hundreds of participants' emotional responses to different things, including happy reunions and cute babies. Many participants said they would react in a negative or aggressive way to the positive things ---- to cry at happy moments and want to pinch a cute baby's face or even tell them \"I want to eat you up!\" But then researchers found that these people were able to calm down from strong emotions more quickly. There are many other examples of times when people respond to a positive experience with a negative emotional reaction. At an exciting concert, fans scream at their idols . People who have just had a big lottery win are often in floods of tears. \"These findings advance our understanding of how people express and control their emotions, which is importantly related to mental and physical health, the quality of relationships with others, and even how well people work together.\" said Aragon.

{"question": "Environmental activists in South Korea are condemning a government plan to hunt endangered whales for scientific research. They believe the plan is part of an effort to restart commercial whaling activities. Such activities are banned in many countries. South Korea announced the proposal in July at a meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Panama. The head of the South Korean delegation   said the plan was needed to answer questions about minke whale populations. He said the hunt would take place near the South Korean coast. But he did not say how many of the animals would be caught. The International Whaling Commission has yet to make a decision on the South Korean plan. The organization banned commercial whaling in 1986 because of concerns about the survival of whale species. But now, some South Korean fishermen say they are facing a threat from minke whales. They say these animals are eating what would have been their catch. The plan was immediately condemned by anti-whaling nations. Wildlife activists also criticized the proposal. Han Jeong-hee works in Seoul for the environmental group Greenpeace.\"It's really regretful to hear that the South Korean government is, like, considering conducting scientific whaling. Scientific whaling is just, like, thinly disguised commercial whaling. And, you know, we are of course against all commercial whaling. Japan's the only country that is doing scientific whaling at the moment and South Korea is just trying to follow that.\" Apart from the plan in South Korea, an aquarium   in the American state of Georgia also wants to import eighteen beluga whales from Russia. The United States currently has 31 beluga whales. They are living in six aquariums and marine parks. Four of them are at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta. The Georgia Aquarium has asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for permission to import the beluga whales. If it was approved, aquarium officials would send some of the animals to the other facilities. The Georgia Aquarium says it hopes to use the beluga whales in research, education and breeding programs. They currently are being held at a Russian research center. Yet many people oppose the plan. They say it is wrong to catch any wild animal. NOAA officials are studying how the beluga whales might be affected by being brought to the United States. They also want to know whether the Georgia Aquarium and its partners can properly care for the whales and how they might be used in educational activities.

{"question": "Every time you turn on the television or take a ride in a car ,you could be adding to a problem called acid rain . In this article, you'll learn how acid is created, and how it affects us, and more importantly, what we all can do to prevent it. How is acid rain created? When people use fuels , such as coal and gasoline, poisonous gases are given off. When these gases mix with rain, acid rain forms. Many power stations burn fuels in order to create the electricity  that we use in our homes and offices every day. Cars and trucks also send these gases into the air when they burn gasoline .When rain mixes with these gases, harmful things called acids form. This is acid rain. How does acid rain affect us? Acid rain damages everything that it touches. It poisons our rivers, ponds, lakes, and oceans along with all the life in them. It pollutes our soil and crops, harms trees, and can even kill fish and plants. Acid rain also eats away at buildings. How can we prevent acid rain? We need to cut down on the pollution that gets into our air. Turn off lights, television, and other electrical appliances if you are not using them, Walk or take a bike whenever possible. If you are travelling a long distance, take a bus or train to save fuel. As research shows, acid rain harms our environment.

{"question": "Three Yale University professors agreed in a discussion that the automobile was what one of them called \"Public Health Enemy No. 1 in this century\". Besides polluting the air and overcrowding the cities, cars are involved in more than half the disastrous accidents, and they contribute to heart disease \"because we won't walk anywhere any more,\" said Richard Weeinaman, professor of medicine and public health. Speaking of many of those man-made dangers of the automobile, Arthur W. Galson, professor of biology, said it was possible to make a kerosene-burning turbine car that would \"lessensmog by a very large factor\". But he expressed doubt whether Americans were willing to give up moving about the countryside at 90 miles per hour in a large vehicle. \"America seems wedded to the motor car--every family has to have at least two, and one has to be a convertible   with 300 horsepower,\" professor Galson continued. \"Is this the way of life that we choose because we treasure these values?\" For professor Sears, part of the blame lies with \"a society that regards profit as a supreme value, under the illusion that anything that's technically possible is, therefore, morally justified\". Professor Sears also called the country's dependence on its modern automobiles \"terrible economics\" because of the large horsepower used simply \"moving one individual to work\". But he admitted that Americans have painted themselves into a corner by allowing the national economy to become so dependent on the automobile industry. \"The solution,\" Dr Weeinerman said, \"is not finding a less dangerous fuel but a different system of inner city transportation. Because of the increasing use of cars, public transportation has been allowed to wither   and grow worse, so that if you can't walk to where you want to go, you have to have a car in most cities,\" he declared.

{"question": "How Super Are Supermarkets? Buying e week's groceries is tiring. You want to get it over and done with quickly, so you head for the nearest supermarket, you find everything you need under one roof, and you feel glad that those days of going in and out of different shops in the high street are over. Supermarkets seem to be a big plus. There is a downside, though. In the UK 90% of all the food people consume is bought at 5 different supermarket chains. This makes these companies extremely powerful, which lets them use their huge buying power to squeeze small suppliers to get the best deal. Milk is a good example. Supermarkets like to use things like milk, which is the top of almost everyone's shopping list to attract customers. To offer the lowest price possible to the consumer, the supermarkets force dairy farmers to sell milk at less than the cost of production. Supermarkets guarantee their good profits while farmers are left struggling to make ends meet, and the taxpayer pays to support the system without even knowing it. It would be nice if local grocers supported local agriculture. But for the big supermarkets this just doesn't make sense. Supermarkets don't want little farmers thinking they can decide prices. So supermarkets have started a global search for the cheapest possible agricultural produce. In many supermarkets it is difficult to find anything which is produced locally. UK farmers used to grow a lot of apples. Not anymore. In 1999 36% of apples were imported. By 2015 the figure had risen to 80% and the domestic production of apples had fallen by two thirds. The consumer might just be happy to get a reasonably priced meal made up of foods from Thailand, Spain, Italy and Zambia, but we should also bear in mind the Influence on local producers. Then there's packaging. Supermarkets like everything to be packed and wrapped so it can be piled neatly on shelves. Supermarkets produce nearly 10 million tons of waste packaging in the UK every year, of which less 5%is recycled. Some supermarkets make sure that large recycling bins are obvious in their car parks, showing that they are environment-friendly. But that is just an image. When a new supermarket is planned there are claims about the number of new jobs that will be created. Unfortunately, the number of jobs lost in the area is larger than the number of new positions in the supermarket. On average each new supermarket leads to the loss of 276 jobs. However, the modern world is all about shopping, and the freedom to buy whatever you what, so it would be impossible to stop people shopping at some particular kind of shop. But some measures do need to be taken when small suppliers lose profits, local producers suffer, sea levels rise and jobs are lost, anyway, we can't just care about a free car park and special offers.

{"question": "One Canada, Two Languages Canada is one of the few nations in the world to have two official languages: English and French. There are 10 provinces in the country but only one of these--Quebec is known as \"French Canada\". This is because it was founded by French explorers while British adventurers discovered the rest. Canada left the British empire  in 1867 to become an independent country, and English and French have been recognized as the official languages ever since. Most people speak English as their first language and the two national television networks broadcast in English throughout the country. Apart from in Quebec and a few places on the east coast, French television is very rare. The same goes for traffic signs and menus. For example, outside of Quebec, there are only a few places where you'll see traffic signs in French. In restaurants, it's almost impossible to find French on the menu unless you are in the heartland of French Canada. However, all products sold in Canada must, by law, have labels and instructions in both languages. In Canada's English speaking provinces, official bilingualism  means that students can choose to complete a special French language course. Under this programme, they are taught most of their subjects in French. If a student begins the course in kindergarten  or Grade One, it is likely that all their lessons will be in French.

Now, we have comfortable buses in London. I would like to describe how comfortable they are. First, the number of seats on a bus has been reduced from 44 to 19. The reason why the number of seats is now 19 is that the seats have been changed to big and comfortable sofas. Originally, they changed the normal seats to airplane seats and took out ten seats from the buses. However, every customer wanted to have a more comfortable seat on the bus when they went on long-distance trips, so they changed them to sofas.

{"question": "Two-thirds of the world's major rivers have now been disrupted with more than 50,000 dams in an attempt to stole water and provide power. In the US,there are more than 85,000 dams,disrupting large and small rives, and in most cases transforming natural flow.The most famous of these,the Hoover Dam, constructed in the l930's,is mainly responsible for the fact that the Colorado River no longer reaches the ocean. Dams, besides all their attractive benefits, also have negative impacts. Creating a reservoir  means a large area must be flooded. Communities may lose their land, houses and culturally impotent sites. Environmentally, the new reservoir can be a paradise for wildlife, especially birds. However, it can cause greenhouse gas emissions and poison the water for fish. Also, the dramatic rise and fall of water levels during dam releases is too extreme for plains and animals to cope with, resulting in dead zones around the shores of reservoirs. Fish that lay their eggs in the shallows, for example, may find a few hours later that those sites are high and dry. Dams don't just block water flow. They also prevent fish migrations, and are a barrier to sediment  flows. Instead of rushing downriver, sediments get backed up against the dam wall, which cause the reservoir level to increase over time.However, sediments which are rich in nutrients have become a problem. The fertility of the entire system can be influenced, with soils lost during seasonal rains not being replaced. Perhaps the biggest problem can be seen in deltas , often host to large cities,which are sinking into the oceans.

{"question": "New crime prediction software should reduce not only the murder rate, but the rate of other crimes. Developed by Richard Berk, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, the software has already used in Baltimore and Philadelphia to predict which individuals on probation  or parole  are most likely to murder and to be murdered. \"When a person goes on probation or parole he is supervised  by an officer. The question is 'what level of supervision is appropriate?'\" said Berk. It used to be that parole officers used the person's criminal record, and their judgment to make decisions. \"This research replaces those _ ,\" he said. Technology helps determine level of supervision. On average there is one murder for every 100,000 people. Even among high-risk groups the murder rate is one in 100. Predicting such a rare event is very difficult, but advances in computer technology works. Years ago, the researchers made a dataset of more than 60,000 various crimes. Using the software they developed, they found some much more likely to commit murder when paroled or probated. They could identify eight future murderers out of 100. Berk's software examines roughly two dozen variables , from criminal record to geographic location. The type of crimes, and more importantly, the age at which that crime was committed, were two of the most predictive variables. \"People assume that if someone murdered then they will murder in the future,\" said Berk. \" What really matters is what that person did as a young individual. Predicting future crimes sounds well. But we aren't anywhere near being able to do that.\" \"Berk's scientific answer leaves policymakers with difficult questions. By labeling one group of people as high risk, and supervise them closely, there should be fewer murders, which the potential victims should be happy about. It also means that those high-risk individuals will be supervised more aggressively.

(AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition  Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom. The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground. They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the \"disturbing schools\" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white. Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. \"I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,\" Johnson said in the statement. Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages. The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator. In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school.

However, dogs can't offer advice or make you a cup of tea when you need one; and precious stones are cold comfort when you need a hug, and a shoulder to cry on. What are Friends? There are many ways to describe a friend. Friends are the family you can choose for yourself. Friends are a much better medication than medication is, and people who spend time with friends are happier with their lives as they are less lonely. A good friend will put you to bed when you're lost consciousness. Ensure you're not laid on your back, and remember to remove your shoes. You should be able to tell a true friend anything without being judged by them. How do Friendships Begin? This is an easy question. Find someone else who has similar interests with you. You now have another person to talk to about your shared interest but remember they like to talk too, so be prepared to shut up and listen once in a while. Hopefully they will have other friends and will introduce you to them, thereby expanding your circle. Friendships which begin due to location, for example, next-door neighbors or school classmates, rarely survive transitions such as moving to other neighborhoods, schools, colleges, jobs, immigration, and so forth. Attend a school reunion and you'll wonder what on earth you ever had in common with these people other than your age, although it is possible to have a friendship with someone you met at school. Mutually maintain it, and eventually become godparent or \"uncle\" to each others' children. How Friendships are Maintained To have a friend you must also be a friend and be prepared to be there for them should they need you. Failure in this respect would label you and you would most probably be abandoned. Boundaries Like every other relationship you have in your life, there are boundaries you shouldn't cross with your friends. One of those is money: Don't lend to your friend and don't ask for a loan yourself. Friends are unpaid counselors ,but phoning them at 2 am because you're awake and would like a chat is not a good idea. Neither is phoning them at 10 am if you know they're a shift-worker. Friends are people who need some space and quiet time. Generally, it all boils down to mutual respect and understanding. It's not a good plan to interrupt your friend while they're on a date/on holiday/attending an orchestral recital/at a funeral. Trust Trust is the most vital element in any relationship. If you're not trustworthy then you probably don't deserve friends, so try to remember that you promised to see that dull film with them or applaud them at their first attempt at a karaoke or an Open Mic night. If you have promised to look after their clothes while they go for a bet, then make sure you do. You might like to carry enough cash to help them out too, as you never know when that situation might be reversed. Don't lie to your friend: if they know you well they'll know you're lying or will at least be suspicious. If you find out something that you know will hurt your friend, be tactful . Do they need to know? Would they appreciate knowing? Can you tell their mum so she can break the news? Cowardly, yes, but mums usually have a much better way with words. Remember, if you do decide to tell them and it's painful, they will probably need some time alone, after lashing out at the closest thing--you. In that case, play the waiting game. Then don't beat them up about it afterwards. A Friend for Life Strong friendships can last a lifetime with care and consideration. The benefits are multi-folds; you've got someone to share birthday cake with, and especially for single people, a pub meal or a trip to the cinema is no fun alone, is it? Plus it's always nice to know there's someone there for you, as you're there for them, through the bad times as well as the good. Altogether now: Oh I get by with a little help from my friends.

O., Lansford, B. and Black, J. W., 2004, \"Employee turnover   and job performance: monitoring the influences of salary growth and promotion\", Journal of Armchair Psychology, vol. 113, no.1, pp. 56-64. In this article Trevor et al. review the influences of pay and job opportunities in respect of job performance, turnover rates and employees' job attitude. The authors use data gained through organizational surveys of blue-chip companies in Vancouver, Canada to try to identify the main cause of employee turnover and whether it is linked to salary growth. Their research focuses on assessing a range of pay structures such as pay for performance and organizational reward plans. The article is useful as Trevor et al. suggest that there are numerous reasons for employee turnover and a variety of differences in employees' job attitude and performance. The main limitation of the article is that the survey sample was restricted to mid-level management, thus the authors indicate that further, more extensive research needs to be undertaken to develop a more in-depth understanding of employee turnover and job performance. As this article was published in a professional journal, the findings can be considered reliable. It will be useful additional information for the research on pay structures.

{"question": "Without the atmosphere there would be no weather, no wind, rain, snow, or clouds. Air is all around us; we live at the bottom of a great ocean of air. It is invisible, but we can feel it when it moves. There are miles of air above us, pressing down with great weight on the earth and everything on it. Because air presses down on us from all directions at the same time, and because we are able to bear   this weight, we do not seem to feel it. But scientists have proved that air has this weight, and that anything that has weight creates  a force called pressure. As changes in air pressure take place, they, make air move. Air is a gas that expands  when heated, gets lighter, and moves upward. When air is cooled, it gets heavier, sinks close to the earth's surface, and flows like water in a great river. As warn air rises, cold air rushes in to take its place. 'Thus winds originate  . The winds that blow high above us are caused by the warmer air running away from colder air. The wind we feel near the earth's surface is the heavy colder air trying hard to catch the warmer air. Changes in temperature cause the air to move.

After an hour's flight one of the scientists wrote in his book, \"Look here for probable metal.\" Walking across hilly ground, four scientists reported, \"This ground should be searched for metals.\" From an airplane over a hilly wasteland a scientist sent back by radio one word \"Uranium.\" None of the scientists had X-ray eyes: they had no magic powers for looking down below the earth's surface. They were merely putting to use one of the newest methods of locating minerals in the ground---using trees and plants as signs that certain minerals may lie beneath the ground on which the trees and plants are growing. This newest method of searching for minerals is based on the fact that minerals deep in the earth may affect the kind of bushes and trees that grow on the surface.  At Watson Bar Creek, a mineral search group gathered bags of tree seeds. Boxes were filled with small branches from the trees. Roots were dug and put into boxes. Each bag and box was carefully marked. In a scientific laboratory the parts of the forest trees were burned to ashes and tested. Each small part was examined to learn whether there were minerals in it. Study of the roots, branches, and seeds showed no silver. But there were small amounts of gold in the roots and a little less gold in the branches and seeds. The seeds growing nearest to the tree trunk had more gold than those growing on the ends of the branches.

{"question": "People used to think that wetlands were wasted land. Developers would drain them with ditches ,fill them in with tons of soil,and build houses,schools,and parking areas on them.Then scientists began to realize the important role wetlands played in the environment. Wetlands act like giant sponges  during storms.They soak up extra storm water and afterward release it slowly back into the water cycle.This helps prevent flooding. Towns where people have drained wetlands have found that in a big storm,their streets and homes are often flooded because there are no wetlands to soak up the excess water. Wetlands also act as giant filters where pollutants are absorbed and dissolved over time.Though wetlands can become polluted from dumping,wastewater,and fertilizer runoff from farm fields,they are able to process some pollutants over time because of all the microorganisms and plants living there. Wetlands are especially important for providing homes and breeding grounds to millions of birds,fish,and amphibians worldwide. Many wetlands have become national wildlife refuges ,where you can go to take pictures and look at birds and animals. The Everglades are a huge wetland that once covered more than four million acres of southern Florida. Sometimes called the \"river of grass\",the Everglades are a shallow sheet of water that slowly flowed across a grassy plain. In the late 1800s people began draining parts of the Everglades for development. Roads were built and towns sprang up.The Everglades shrank to half its original size. Cities like Miami grew up where once there was a thriving wetland. Sewage and waste from the cities were pumped into the remaining wetlands. Over time scientists began to see the importance of the Everglades. Even with its smaller size,the Everglades filtered the pollutants coming from the cities,absorbing the worst of it like a sewage treatment plant. During storms the Everglades protected the cities from storm surge flooding. They also are just a great place to visit and see wildlife.

{"question": "When asked about happiness, we usually think of something extraordinary, an   delight, which seems to get rarer the older we get.    For kids, happiness has a magical quality. Their delight at winning a race or getting a new bike is unreserved .    In the teenage years the concept  of happiness changes. Suddenly it's conditional on such things as excitement, love and popularity. I can still recall the excitement of being invited to dance with the most attractive boy at the school party.    In adulthood the things that bring deep joy----love, marriage, birth----also bring responsibility and the risk of loss. For adults, happiness is complicated     My definition for happiness is \"the capacity for enjoyment\". The more we can enjoy what we have, the happier we are. It's easy to overlook the pleasure we get from the company of friends, the freedom to live where we pleased, and even good health. I experienced my little moments of pleasure yesterday. First I was overjoyed when I shut the last lunch-box and had the house to myself. Then I spent an uninterrupted morning writing, which I love. When the kids and my husband came home, I enjoyed their noise after the quiet of the day. Psychologists tell us that to be happy we need a mix of enjoyable leisure time and satisfying work. I don't think that my grandmother, who raised 14 children, had much of either. She did have a network of close friends and family, and maybe this is what satisfied her.     We, however, with so many choices and such pressure  to succeed in every area, have turned happiness into one more thing we've got to have. We've so self-conscious about our \"right\" to it that it's making us miserable. So we pursue   it and equal it with wealth and success, without noticing that the people who have those things aren't necessarily happier     Happiness isn't about what happens to us----it's about how we see what happens to us.

When someone else says that his memory is poor, he really means that he does not give it enough chance to become strong.

But if he tells us that he has a poor memory, many of us think that his parents are to blame, and few of us know that it is just his own fault. Have you ever found that some people can't read or write but they have better memories? This is because they cannot read or write and they have to remember things; they cannot write them down in a little notebook.

{"question": "Society is the term to describe human beings gathered together by social networks tand power networks. It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does, but, only refer to those things that everybody depends upon ,for example, public services, governments, and all kinds of communities. A society must keep even the poorest and weakest members willing to help even the richest and strongest, so it is very concerned with citizenship, rights, ethics ( )and time limits. These are basic ways to achieve fairness. If they break down badly, people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other, refusing to help each other, or seeing those who have more as cheats. When this happens, it is time for the society to break down or fail. Theft, violence and war are things that can make a society break down. A new society may be formed out of the collapse  of an old failed one when people of different kinds reach an agreement about fairness and are willing to live together in harmony again. To adapt to the society, people should make sure that their behavior can be supported by the society, that is to say, there must be some social rules on which citizens base what they do. However, some people take risks that the society will support them when they do whatever they intend to. For instance, they may refuse to obey the law, and count on their fellow society members to free them in a court of appeal, which harms the society. Therefore we need a social contract which sets out rules for the society.

{"question": "Why Doesn't Anybody Copy Apple? Apple's products are the envy of the world. They have been spectacularly successful and are widely imitated, if not copied. The minute Apple crystallizes a product, everyone knows how to compete. This idea that the basis of competition is set by Apple and then the race is on to climb the path of improvement is unquestionable. When Apple releases a product that defines a category or dramatically changes the structure of an industry, it becomes obvious what needs to be built. But what I wonder is why everyone wants to copy Apple's products but nobody wants to copy being Apple? I can think of two reasons. Firstly, Apple is not worth copying because it's not successful; secondly, Apple's success cannot be copied because it is a magical process. There is a great deal of evidence for the first hypothesis. The idea of Apple being successful is not something reflected in its stock price. Being valued lower than the average company in the S&P 500 indicates that to whatever degree Apple was successful in the past, it's not seen by the vast majority of observers as successful in the future. Why should one bother copying Apple if it results in being punished with a low valuation? If one works really hard at innovation and then that innovation becomes commoditized very quickly, why should one bother? When innovation practitioners are asked what makes Apple successful,the answers regarding the cause of this success border on the mythical.The climax of this hypothesis is the \"chief-sorcerer\"theory of success which places one magician,like Steve Jobs,in charge of casting all the right spells  What about Apple's own opinion of what makes it tick? Tim Cook refers to a great team and integration of hardware, software and services as unique Apple advantages. It's a better explanation. Integration is something that can take a long time, but it is possible with great effort. A few companies are starting to make moves in that direction, but efforts are half-hearted. There is no \"move the Earth\" panic to become an integrated company from Samsung, Google or Microsoft. My own suspicion is that Apple is more aware of what makes it special than it lets out. However, as Tim points out, it's not a formula. It's complex, it's subtle, but it's not magic. It's a process that requires a degree of faith and courage.

No matter what the amount was, my mother always thanked the givers, wrote their names and addresses on her large envelope, and placed the money inside. And then we returned to our apartment, and my mother counted the money. The yield didn't match the effort: I don't think she collected more than $10. Still, she sent the collection to the organization. Even as a child, I knew my mother's actions were great, which aroused my pride in her. Asking poor people to give to an organization which aimed to help others wasn't what you did. Other charities gave to these folks; you didn't ask them to give.

And I volunteer my time to teach little girls and fix our badly broken public schools. I do these things because I believe I've been given much, so much is required of me.

{"question": "Thirty-two people watched kitty Genovese being killed right beneath their windows. She was their neighbor. Yet none of the 32 helped her. Not one even called the police. Was this in gunman cruelty? Was it lack of feeling about one's fellow man? Not so, say scientists John Barley and Bib Fatane. These men went beyond the headlines to probe  the reasons why people didn't act. They found that a person has to go through two steps before he can help. First he has to notice that is an emergency . Suppose you see a middle-aged man fall to the side-walk. Is he having a heart attack? Is he in a coma   from diabetes ? Or is he about to sleep off a drunk? Is the smoke coming into the room from a leak in the air conditioning? Is it steam pipes? Or is it really smoke from a fire? It's not always easy to tell if you are faced with a real emergency. Second, and more important, the person faced with an emergency must feel personally responsible. He must feel that he must help, or the person won't get the help he needs. The researchers found that a lot depends on how many people are around. They had college students in to be tested. Some came alone. Some came with one or two others. And some came in large groups. The receptionist started them off on the tests. Then she went into the next room. A curtain divided the testing room and the room into which she went. Soon the students heard a scream, the noise of file cabinets falling and a cry for help. All of this had been pre-recorded on a tape-recorder. Eight out of ten of the students taking the test alone acted to help. Of the students in pairs, only two out of ten helped. Of the students in groups, none helped. In other words, in a group, Americans often fail to act. They feel that others will act. They, themselves, needn't. They do not feel any direct responsibility. Are people bothered by situations where people are in trouble? Yes. Scientists found that the people were emotional, they sweated, they had trembling hands. They felt the other person's trouble.

Being a kidult has become a lifestyle choice among young people across Asia. Some kidults collect toys they once played with. Hello Kitty, Garfield, and Snoopy have many adult fans around the world. It is not unusual to see a 20something woman with a big, Garfieldshaped cushion on her sofa or a Hello Kitty mobile phone accessory . Other kidults still enjoy children's stories and fairy tales. For example, even an edition of the Harry Potter novels with an adult cover came out in Britain.

Adults who value their childhood and hold on to pure, childlike emotion may be needed in such a rough and dry society,\" said a professor in a Korean University. He added that kidult culture might fill the generation gap between adults and kids. It could give children and their parents books, movies, and cartoon shows to enjoy together. Tim Greenhalgh, a professor in London explained that some kidults just refuse to grow up. They cling to  childhood because life in a busy and stressful city frightens them.

{"question": "We chat with our colleagues all the time when we have lunch, gossip in the tearoom, or leave work together. Sharing your personal life brings you closer to your coworkers and builds trust within your team. But revealing too much about yourself to colleagues, managers or human resources staff can cause difficulties and even endanger your work. It's important to keep the right balance between getting along with colleagues and maintaining your privacy. \"Communication in the office is tricky and complicated. You can neither spread chatter, nor be too silent and shut yourself off from others,\" said Yang Yudan, deputy HR director at P&G. According to her, there are several safe topics to talk about with colleagues during the break, such as the weather or movies. Women like to talk about makeup and clothing, while men are fond of sports and online games.

{"question": "Across the rich world, well-educated people increasingly work longer than the less-skilled. Some 65% of American men aged 62-74 with a professional degree are in the workforce, compared with 32% of men with only a high-school certificate. This gap is part of a deepening divide between the well-education well off and the unskilled poor. Rapid technological advance has raised the incomes of the highly skilled while squeezing those of the unskilled. The consequences, for individual and society, are profound. The world is facing as astonishing rise in the number of old people, and they will live longer than ever before. Over the next 20 years the global population of those aged 65 or more will almost double, from 600 million to 1.1 billion. The experience of the 20th century, when greater longevity translated into more years in retirement rather than more years at work, has persuaded many observers that this shift will lead to slower economic growth, while the swelling ranks of pensioners will create government budget problems. But the notion of a sharp division between the working young and the idle old misses a new trend, the growing gap between the skilled and the unskilled. Employment rates are falling among younger unskilled people, whereas older skilled folk are working longer. The divide is most extreme in America, where well-educated baby-boomers   are putting off retirement while many less-skilled younger people have dropped out of the workforce. That even the better-off must work longer to have a comfortable retirement. But the changing nature of work also plays a big role. Pay has risen sharply for the highly educated, and those people continue to reap rich rewards into old age because these days the educated elderly are more productive than the preceding generation.

Under the old rules, the cars used by minister-level officials could be replaced as often as every five years, Li said.

The cars possessed by their departments should be used on demand. \"It violates the rules for lower-ranking --- even county-level-officials to be allocated cars,\" Li said. Purchases of vehicles for official use have been heavily investigated, as they account for a large expenditure   of public funds every year. A survey on the Web news www.ifeng.com found 64 percent of respondents believed the new rule will be difficult to carry out because it is related to officials' interests. \"Local government departments had halted  approvals for requests for such vehicles and had started to work on new quotas  under the new rules,\" Li said. \"The future reform of official vehicle use will introduce market mechanisms and monetization.\" Premier Wen Jiabao said in the annual government work report on Saturday that expenditures on such vehicles will not increase in 2011 compared with a year ago.

{"question": "Nowadays, the increase in the prices of agricultural products is one of the greatest concerns of the people and the government. The government has announced a series of policies  to prevent the prices from rising further. Rising housing prices is still a big concern for the people, but since farm products are needed every day, the increase in their prices has made life very difficult for them. Many people may think the increase will help farmers. But have higher prices of farm products really benefited the farmers? Take the increase in vegetable prices in the first half of this year for example. Though natural disasters such as droughts and spring frost did not cause the prices of farm products to increase greatly--in fact, prices of some products did not increase at all--vegetables have become dearer by as much as 20 percent compared to that of last year. This means only a small part (or even none) of the extra money that city people have paid to buy farm products has gone to the farmers. The extra cost actually has gone to middlemen. As the fact shows, just increasing prices of farm products will have negative influence on the entire economy. On one hand, the price increase has created some abnormal phenomena, which hurts farmers' interests. On the other hand, resources will enter the agriculture because of the high price of farm products, which would finally create negative effect on the whole economy.

{"question": "2010 was the year the Earth struck back. Earthquakes, heat waves, floods, volcanoes, super typhoons, blizzards  , landslides and droughts killed at least a quarter million people in 2010 - the deadliest year in more than a generation. More people were killed worldwide by natural disasters this year than have been killed in terrorism attacks in the past 40 years combined. \"It just seemed like it was back-to-back  and it came in waves,\" said Craig Fugate, who heads the US Federal Emergency Management Agency. It handled a record number of disasters in 2010. \"The term \"100-year event' really lost its meaning this year.\" And we have ourselves to blame most of the time, scientists and disaster experts say. Even though many disasters have the ring of random chance, the hand of man made this a particularly deadly, costly, extreme and strange year for everything from wild weather to earthquakes. Poor construction and development practices make earthquakes more deadly than they need be. More people live in poverty in vulnerable buildings  in crowded cities. That means that when the ground shakes, the river floods, or the tropical cyclone hits, more people die. Disasters from the Earth, such as earthquakes and volcanoes \"are pretty much constant,\" said Andreas Schraft, vice president of catastrophic perils for the Geneva-based insurance giant Swiss Re. \"All the change that's made is man-made.\" The January earthquake that killed well more than 220,000 people in Haiti is a perfect example. Port-au-Prince has nearly three times as many people - many of them living in poverty- and more poorly built shanties  ,than it did 25 years ago. So had the same quake hit in 1985 instead of 2010; total deaths would have probably been in the 80,000 range, said Richard Olson, director of disaster risk reduction at Florida International University. Climate scientists say Earth's climate also is changing thanks to man-made global warming, bringing extreme weather, such as heat waves and flooding. The excessive  amount of extreme weather that dominated 2010 is a classic sign of man-made global warming that climate scientists have long warned about. They calculate that the killer Russian heat wave - setting a national record of 111 degrees - would happen once every 100,000 years without global warming. Data show that 18 countries broke their records for the hottest day ever. \"The Earth strikes back in response to bad human decision-making,\" said Debarati Guha Sapir.\" \"It's almost as if the policies, the government policies and development policies, are helping the Earth strike back instead of protecting from it. We've created conditions where the slightest thing the Earth does is really going to have a surprising impact.\" White House science adviser John Holdren said we should get used to climate disasters or do something about global warming. \"The science is clear that we can expect more and more of these kinds of damaging events unless and until society has sharply reduced the amount of heat-trapping gases and particles .\" According to John Holdren, the best way to cut back on the number of natural disasters is  _  .", "subject": "social sciences", "choices": "['to forecast the happening of natural disasters accurately'\n 'to build stronger houses that can stand severe earthquakes and floods'\n 'to make better decisions and policies of city development'\n 'to send out much fewer greenhouse gases and particles']", "answer": "3"}

{"question": "Have you ever wondered why you sometimes take an almost immediate liking to a person you have just met? We often get the first impression of a person based on the color1 of a person's skin or the manner in which he or she dressed. Meaning is conveyed not only by words or verbal languages but also by nonverbal communication systems, such as body behaviors. Nonverbal communication is important because we use the actions of others to learn about their affective emotional states .Our emotions are reflected in our posture, face, and eyes--be it fear, joy, anger, or sadness--so we can express them without ever saying a word .For this reason, most of us rely heavily on what we learn through our eyes.  Nonverbal communication is significant in human interaction because it is usually responsible for the first impressions. More importantly, those first messages usually influence the perception  of everything else that follows. Even how we select friends and sexual partners is grounded in first impressions with nonverbal communication.  Nonverbal communication is important because it is culture-related. It is based on different beliefs, religions, values and customs in different cultures. When, where, how, and to whom people display his or her specific nonverbal behaviors is greatly affected by culture and context. Culture determines what the appropriate nonverbal behavior is. For example, feelings of friendship exist everywhere but their expression varies. It may be appropriate in some countries for man to embrace each other and for women to hold hands; in other countries these displays of affection may be shocking. Each culture has its own specific interpretation on nonverbal communication. What is acceptable in one culture may be completely unacceptable in another. One culture may determine that snapping fingers to call a waiter is acceptable; another may consider this gesture rude.

A pedestrian is killed in a traffic accident in the USA every 110 minutes;one is injured every nine minutes, according to official data. Crosswalk can be especially dangerous for the elderly. Among people 70 and older, 36% of pedestrian deaths in 2006 occurred in crosswalks, compared with 21% of those younger than 70, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.    The Federal Highway Administration(FHWA)advises that next year states increase by nearly 15% the amount of time traffic lights provide for pedestrians to cross the street after the flashing orange hand appears .    FHWA spokesman Doug Hecox says reasons for the change include an aging population that needs more time to cross, health-conscious Americans walking more, children encouraged to walk to prevent getting overweight and high gas prices pushing people to walk instead of driving.    Pedestrian deaths went down by 12% from 5,449 in 1996 to 4,784 in 2006.

{"question": "I once had a house guest from Cuba. During his visit, I happened to throw an old broken blender   in the trash. The next day it was sitting on my counter - in working order. In his world, people simply cannot afford to replace an item which doesn't work properly. They take the time and figure out how to fix it. In Cuba, they are still driving cars from the 1960's, mainly because they do not have a choice. In contrast, the U.S. is a \"throw-away society.\" Statistics show that each American produces six pounds of trash per day. I believe a combination of factors has contributed to this phenomenon. \"Planned obsolescence \" is not a secret. It is a manufacturing   philosophy developed in the 1920's and 1930's, when mass production became popular. The goal is to make a product or part that will fail, or become less desirable over time or after a certain amount of use. This pressures the consumer to buy again. Planned obsolescence does keep costs down. Instead of making an expensive product that will last a long time, businesses produce more affordable, disposable  items. Some electronic items have become so inexpensive that it is cheaper to replace them than to repair them.[:&&Z&X&X&K] Busy people often value their time and convenience more than money. If a car starts to have mechanical problems, replacing it with a newer, more reliable model may be more appealing than tolerating it being in the garage for a week. In addition, advertising trains consumers to want what is new and improved. It convinces them that the more they have, the happier they will be. Unlike people in many developing countries, we live in a world of abundance. A study by Dr. Timothy Jones of the University of Arizona also found that in the U.S., 40-50 percent of all food ready for harvest is wasted.

{"question": "What were you doing before you started reading this? Were you fully focused on another article? Or eating breakfast? Organizing your day? Or were you staring out of the window, feeling restless and bored? It is likely to have been the latter. Brief moments of boredom are universal, and are frequently what drives us to stop what we are doing and move to something that we hope will be more exciting. But although boredom is common, it is neither unimportant nor favorable, according to Dr John Eastwood, a psychologist at York University, Toronto. Eastwood is the joint author ofThe Unengaged Mind, a major new paper on the theory of boredom. Boredom, he points out in the paper, has been connected with overeating, depression, anxiety, and an increased risk of making mistakes. Mistakes at work might not be a matter of life and death for most of us, but if you are an air traffic controller, pilot or nuclear power plant operator, they most certainly can be. Commercial polo Sami Franks confirms that boredom can make pilots lose attention. \"When you fly a lengthy distance, there are two pilots, one of whom is monitoring all the screens while the other does the paperwork, talks to air traffic control and so on. You need to be alert  for landing and takeoff, but once you're 500 ft above the runway, the plane's on autopilot  and it can be very quiet and boring. In a study I saw of pilots who woke up after a short sleep. 30% of them reported seeing the other pilot asleep too,\" said Franks. However, Dr Esther Priyadharshini, a senior lecturer in education at the university of East Anglia, has studied boredom and says it can be seen in a positive light. \"We can't prevent boredom--it's an unavoidable human emotion. We have to accept it and find ways to control it. We all need downtime. There's no need to be fully busy with work at all times.\" she says. Children who complain that they have nothing to do on rainy holidays may try to find other things to focus on. The artist Grayson Perry has reportedly spoken of how long periods of boredom in childhood may have improved his creativity. \"We all need vacant time to mull  things over,\" says Priyadharshini.

{"question": "Nowadays, more and more teenagers use smart phones, tablets and other mobile devices more than ever before. And the amount of time they spend on these devices is only likely to increase in the future. But are all these changes good? We sometimes call children who are able to use mobile devices and technology easily digital natives. They can text, email, get Wi-Fi, and download. Some experts say that long periods of time spent chatting to friends online, playing video games and listening to mp3s, for example, may possibly change how their brains work. Then there is the question of privacy. All this online activity creates a digital footprint. Every time we share a photo or a post on social media, and every time we search for something on the Internet, information about our activity is stored somewhere. Our inability to control what happens to our children's digital footprint and their personal privacy has big possibilities. It might become normal for companies to ask their employees for their social media qualifications. We are also becoming more aware that companies and governments may be able to 'listen in' on our communications. So it is important to make our children aware of the possible results of over sharing. Another area where the digital world may have a big effect is in education. One worry is that kids who spend a lot of time online at home are sometimes unable to socialize properly with other children when they are at school. Other experts point out that, when it comes to children and technology, the children are the experts, not the teachers.

{"question": "About 97% of the world's water is salty and is found in our oceans and seas. But, as we can't drink seawater, how can it be important? Every part of our seas and oceans contains an amazing number of animals and fish that live at different ocean depths. Most of the different species of animals and fish depend on simple plants for their food. These simple plants called algae   drift near the surface of the ocean and use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into food and oxygen. In fact, algae produce over half of the oxygen people breathe. How important seawater is! Each plant or animal in our seas and oceans is an important link in a food chain. The algae are eaten in large amounts by microscopic animals, which are in turn consumed by larger animals. These food chains are delicately balanced. The bad news about the food chains in the oceans is that they are under threat because of man. People once thought that the oceans were so big that it didn't matter if we dumped rubbish into them or caught huge quantities of fish and whales for food. But we now know this is not true and fish stocks in the oceans have started to drop. Thankfully, the world is taking steps to protect the future of our oceans by introducing international agreements to protect marine habitats. Most countries have introduced fishing restrictions to protect fish stocks in the oceans and new techniques are being pioneered to cope with pollution. Finally, the importance of protecting oceans is being made known to more people. This is just the beginning of a long process to protect the oceans for our future.

In England it is believed that education is not only a matter filling a boy's mind with facts in the classroom: education also means the training of character; and one of the best ways of training character is by means of games, especially team games; where a boy or girl has to learn to work with others for his or her team, instead of working for oneself alone.

If I have learned anything about giving thanks, it is this: give it now!While your feeling of appreciation is alive and sincere, act on it. Saying thanks is such an easy way to add to the world's happiness. Saying thanks not only brightens someone else's world, but it also brightens yours. If you're feeling left out, unloved or unappreciated, try reaching out to others. It may be just the medicine you need. Of course, there are times when you can't express gratitude immediately. In that case don't let embarrassment sink you into silence--speak up the first time you have the chance. Once a young minister, Mark Brian, was sent to a remote parish of Kwakiutl Indians in British Columbia. He had been told that the Indians did not have a word for thank you. But Brian soon found that these people had exceptional generosity. Instead of saying thanks, it is their custom to return every favor with a favor of their own, and every kindness with an equal or superior kindness. They do their thanks. I wonder if we had no words in our vocabulary for thank you, would we do a better job of communicating our gratitude? Would we be more responsive, more sensitive and more caring?

{"question": "The term \"smog\" was first used in London during the early 1900's to describe the combination of smoke and fog.  What we typically call \" smog\"  today is a mixture of pollutants but is primarily made up of ground-level ozone   .      Ozone can be beneficial or harmful depending on where it stays. The ozone staying high above the Earth protects human health and the environment, but ground-level ozone is responsible for the choking, coughing, and painful eyes associated with smog. The ozone in smog also prevents plants growth and can cause widespread damage to crops and forest.      Major smog occurrences often are linked to heavy motor vehicle traffic, high temperatures, sunshine, and calm winds. Weather and geography affect the position and severity of smog. Because temperature regulates the length of time it takes for smog to form, smog can form faster and be more severe on a hot and sunny day. When warm air stays near the ground instead of rising and winds are calm, smog may stay trapped over your city for days. As traffic and other sources add more pollutants to the air, the smog gets worse. Smog is often more severe away from the pollution sources because the chemical reactions that cause smog occur in the atmosphere while the reacting chemicals are being moved by the wind.     Smog is a visible example of air pollution. You can look into the distance during the day to see how much smog there is in the air. In addition, most cities measure the concentrations of pollutants in the air and report the results to the public.      Environmental Protection Agency sets national standards for pollutants. Areas that fail to meet the standards for at least one air pollutant are called \"nonattainment    areas. \" New measures are being taken by local governments across the country to reduce air pollution in nonattainment areas. These include: banning charcoal barbecues and wood burning in stoves or fireplaces when pollution levels are high; developing programs to encourage carpooling and voluntary \"ozone actions\" ; limiting traffic in overcrowded areas; expanding or improving public transportation systems;  requiring employers to contribute to employee public transportation costs;  assessing \" smog fees\" on cars according to the number of miles driven and vehicle emissions  produced; and even buying and breaking up older \" super-dirty\"  cars.

{"question": "I was watching some little kids play soccer. These kids were only five or six years old, but they were playing a real game -- a serious game -- two teams, complete with coaches, uniforms, and parents. I didn't know any of them, so I was able to enjoy the game without the distractionof being anxious about winning or losing. The teams were pretty evenly matched. I will just call them Team One and Team Two. Nobody scored in the first period. Then came the second quarter. The Team One coach pulled out what must have been his first team and put in the scrubs , except for his best player who now guarded the goal. The game _ . I guess winning is important even when you're five years old -- because the Team Two coach left his best players in, and the Team One scrubs were no match for them. Team Two packed around the little guy who was now the Team One goalkeeper. He was an outstanding athlete, but he was no match for three or four who were also very good. Team Two began to score. The lone goalkeeper gave it everything he had, desperately throwing his body in front of incoming balls, trying bravely to stop them. Team Two scored two goals in quick succession. It angered the young boy. He became a raging maniac -- shouting, running, diving. With all the strength he could gather, he covered the boy who now had the ball, but that boy kicked it to another boy twenty feet away, and by the time he repositioned himself, it was too late -- they scored a third goal. I soon learned who the goalkeeper's parents were. They were nice, decent-looking people. I could tell that his dad had just come from the office -- he still had his suit and tie on. They yelled encouragement to their son. I became totally absorbed, watching the boy on the field and his parents on the sidelines. After the third goal, the little kid changed. He didn't quit, but he became quietly desperate and futility was written all over him. His father changed, too. He had been urging his son to try harder -- yelling advice and encouragement. But then he became anxious. He tried to say that it was okay -- to hang in there. He sorrowed for the pain his son was feeling. After the fourth goal, I knew what was going to happen. The little boy fetched the ball from the net and handed it to the referee . He just stood there while huge tears rolled down both cheeks. He went to his knees, and he cried the tears of the helpless and brokenhearted. At that moment, I saw the father start onto the field. His wife seized his arm and said, \"Jim, don't. You'll embarrass him.\" But he tore loose from her and ran onto the field. Suit, tie, dress shoe, and all -- he charged onto the field, and he picked up his son so everybody would know that this was his boy, and he hugged him and held him and cried with him. I've never been so proud of a man in my life. He carried him off the field, and when he got close to the sidelines I heard him say, \"Scotty, I'm so proud of you. You were great out there. I want everybody to know that you are my son.\" \"Daddy,\" the boy sobbed. \"I couldn't stop them. I tried, Daddy, but they scored on me.\" \"Scotty, it doesn't matter how many times they scored on you. You're my son, and I'm proud of you. I want you to go back there and finish the game.

Wales, particularly South Wales, became a melting pot of European nationalities and cultures. At first workers from England, Ireland and the rural areas of Wales rushed into the coalfields of South Wales. By 1911, workers from Ireland, Italy and Spain had joined the industrial workforce there. Many of these newcomers were prepared to work for less pay. But during this period, workers, dissatisfied with regular pay cuts, poor safety, the growing trend of employers to pay workers with tokens  , which could only be spent in the company store, returned to the land. In 1891, the rural population of Wales was about 616,000 and by 1911 just over 649,000 people lived and worked in these areas. The rural population continues to grow slowly even today. People from richer parts of the UK, particularly southern England, are buying holiday or retirement homes in Wales. In some areas this has led to a shortage of affordable housing for local people. This, combined with the lack of employment prospects in rural Welsh communities, has started a new movement of people in search of jobs and homes into the towns and cities of Wales and to other parts of the UK and Europe.

Aisa accounted for four of the top five countries and regions to take advantage of the US higher education system. \"Increased numbers of students from China, particularly at the undergraduate level, largely accounts for the growth this past year,\" the report stated. \"They really enroll in a full range of US higher education,\" said Peggy Blumenthal, senior counselor to the president of IIE, the group that made the report. \"20 years ago, students from China only knew of a handful of US insitiutions, but now, they are enrolling in our community colleges, in our small liberal arts institutions, in the research universities. Really spread across the country,\" she said. Chinese mainland was in the number one spot, while India was the number two country of origin. South Korea was third and Canada was number four. China's Taiwan held the number five spot. Saudi Arabia was in sixth with a 44-percent increase, while Japan was seventh, down 14 percent. Blumenthal attributes the increase in the number of Chinese students heading to US colleges to limited university places in China, as well as a feeling from students and their parents than they want a \"unique\" educational experience. China's family planning policy, says Blumenthal, has also meant that families can concentrated resources on a single child.

{"question": "\"Regardless of social class, race, age, men say they hate to shop,\" says Zukin, City University of New York sociology professor. \" Yet when you ask them deeper questions, it turns out that they like to shop. Men generally like to shop for books , music and hardware. But if you ask them about the shopping they do for books or music, they'll say, ' Well , that's not shopping. That's research .'\"        In other words, what men and women call \"buying things\" and how they approach that task are different.         Women will wander through several 1,000-square-meter stores in search of the perfect party dress. Men will wander through 100 Internet sites in search of the perfect digital camcorder.         Women see shopping as a social event. Men see it as a special task or a game to be won.         \"Men are frequently shopping to win,\" says Ann, a marketing professor at Loyola University of Chicago. \"They want to get the best deal.

{"question": "It has been found that less than one shopper in five makes a complete shopping list before going to the store. The reason for this is that seven out of ten of today's purchases  are decided in the store, where the shoppers tend toward impulse  buying. Buying groceries on impulse had risen for the past forty years, and this rise has coincided  with the growth of self-service shopping. However, in grocery stores where clerks wait on customers there is much less impulse buying. It is hard for people to buy on impulse if they have to address a clerk. Psychologists have joined forces with merchandising  experts. It is their job to persuade people to buy products which they may not need or even want until they see them attractively presented. It was discovered by the psychologists that shoppers want help in their purchases. Having so many choices confuses them, and they prefer the package that attracts them. Therefore, it is now more usual for food packers to pay attention to their package design. Attraction depends heavily on the position of the product on the shelf, however. Thus, persuading the shopper to buy is easier if the product is located at eye-level.

{"question": "Concern with money, and then more money, in order to buy the conveniences and luxuries of modern life, has brought great changes to the lives of most Frenchmen. More people are working harder than ever before in France. In the cities the traditional leisurely midday meal is disappearing. Offices, shops, and factories are discovering the great efficiency of a short lunch hour in company lunch rooms. In almost all lines of work emphasis now falls on ever increasing output. Thus the \"typical\" Frenchman produces more, earns more, and buys more consumer goods than his counterpart of only a generation ago. He gains in creature comfort and ease of life. What he loses to some extent is his sense of personal uniqueness, or individuality. Some say that France has been Americanized. This is because the United States is a world symbol of the technological society and its consumer products. The so called Americanization of France has its critics. They fear that \"assembly line life\" will lead to the disappearance of the pleasures of the more graceful and leisurely (but less productive) old French style. What will happen, they ask, to taste, elegance, and the cultivation of the good things in life to joy in the smell of a freshly picked apple, a stroll by the river, or just happy hours of conversation in a local cafe? Since the late 1950s life in France has indeed taken on qualities of rush, tension, and the pursuit of material gain. Some of the strongest critics of the new way of life are the young, especially university students. They are concerned with the future, and they fear that France is threatened by the triumph of this competitive, goods-oriented culture. Occasionally, they have reacted against the trend with considerable violence. In spite of the critics, however, countless Frenchmen are committed to keeping France in the forefront of the modern economic world.

{"question": "Americans, generally speaking, make an effort to be friendly with their colleagues, neighbours and other people they often run into. This often takes the form of a simple greeting like \"How's it going?\" or \"What's up ?\" This is simply a way of saying I see you and I recognize you. Americans also show this friendliness in \"small talk\". Small talk is a casual conversation that Americans engage in when they meet on the street, in the shop or in the office before a meeting. Usually the topics of such small talk will be something that everyone is familiar with, the weather, sports, traffic, hobbies or what's on television. The topic of the conversation is not as important as the effort make to spend a few minutes with the other person. Small talk shows that you are a considerate person who is interested in others and who is willing to take the time to get to know people. Small talk is used in the business world to create a friendly atmosphere and to put everyone at ease before the serious matters of business are discussed. Often businessmen will spend a few minutes talking about the weather or sports before a meeting. This form of small talk only lasts a few minutes before the American businessman wants to \"get down to business.\" Asians are very skilled at making casual conversation. However, they often find it difficult to make small talk with Americans because they don't know what to say, how to say it and who to say it to.

{"question": "Should we say goodbye to chivalry   in the age of sex equality? Chivalry began as a response to the violence of the Middle Ages. PierMassimo Forni, the founder of the Civility Institute, says chivalry \"as a form of treatment inspired by the sense that there was something special about women and that they deserve added respect.\" Today \"chivalry\" is often used as a term for \"gentlemanly\" behavior, related to \"fair sex\", honor, courage and loyalty. But we can hardly see chivalry nowadays with many women demanding to be treated equally in the workplace. According to a 2013 survey carried out by the British Daily Mail, only one in seven men will offer their seat to a woman on a bus or train; over three-quarters of men don't offer to help carry a heavy bag or suitcase for women. In many cases, it's not because these men are being insensitive, but on the contrary, they say they are unwilling to help women because they are worried about making them embarrassed. These men may worry too much. According to the same survey, only seven percent of women view acts like holding open doors as unpleasant. \"Men seem confused by the modern 'sex equality' message\", psychologist and relationship expert Donna Dawson told the Daily Mail. \"This message was meant for the workplace and was never meant to replace good manners. Men will always be the stronger sex physically, so it is natural for them to show consideration for women.\" So, should the acts of chivalry be brought back?

{"question": "Some Chinese new-rich like eating shark fin soup because they think it shows their class. However, for the Chinese NBA idol Yao Ming, doing so is unacceptable as the practice has led to the overfishing of sharks. When Yao and his wife Ye Li got married in 2007, they publicly announced that they would not allow shark fin soup to be served at their wedding banquet. Actually, Yao had been saying no to shark fins since 2006, when he was appointed as the Goodwill Ambassador for wild life protection. Now, the 226-cm big guy is resorting to his personal influence to encourage more to say no to eating the soup and to raise awareness of animal protection. \"Sharks are friends of human beings. They are not our food,\" Yao said. Other celebrity athletes like Olympic champions Li Ning and Kong Linghui are following on the heels of Yao, throwing themselves into serving the public as Goodwill Ambassadors for wild animal rescue. Recent reports about Yao's retirement have saddened tens of thousands of basketball fans both at home and abroad. Yet Yao's influence goes far beyond the basketball courts. Yao has engaged himself in charity and public welfare services for quite a while. When the devastating 8.0-magnitude earthquake hit Wenchuan in southwest China in 2008, Yao donated 2 million yuan . \"When I was a little boy, my parents and teachers told me to help others and to be a good man,\" Yao recalled.  \"But I could not donate then because I had not much pocket money.

{"question": "Every year there are changes in climate in different parts of the world.Some of these changes are due to natural causes.However,some climate changes are caused by air pollution and these changes may increase. If the pollution affects the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,the results are likely to be serious.There is only a small part of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.But it has an important function in keeping the balance between radiation from the sun entering the atmosphere and radiation leaving the Earth.Some of the radiation is absorbed by the Earth and some is radiated back into the atmosphere.The carbon dioxide in the atmosphere prevents some of the radiation from leaving the atmosphere.Thus the heat remains in the atmosphere and carbon dioxide helps to prevent the temperature of the Earth from falling. If the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increased as a result of air pollution,the temperature of the atmosphere may rise.This might cause the ice in the North and South to melt.If this happened,the sea level could rise and parts of the Earth would be flooded.This is not quite likely but the possibility exists. There is also a fairly strong possibility that the dust level in the atmosphere will rise as a result of industrial pollution.This dust pollution will reflect sunlight back onto space.If this happens,less sunlight will reach the Earth and the temperature will fall. Another danger comes from the destruction of the Earth's vegetation such as the forest of Brazil,which is being cleared away for farmland and cities.Trees use carbon dioxide and their destruction may upset the balance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Recent Erasmus statistics  show that nearly 15,600 UK students spent up to a year in another European country through the program during 2013-2014 school year, up 115 percent since 2007. The figures reflect that more young people in the UK are realizing the value of receiving international experience. \"The UK needs graduates who have the skills and confidence to compete worldwide, and can compete against foreign talent that may speak more languages and have wider international experience,\" said Rebecca Hughes, director of education at the British Council. Most UK students would like to go to the United States, followed by Australia, France, Canada and Germany, the findings show, but 42 percent of those who took the questionnaire were interested in traveling outside of the English-speaking world. Why do UK students want to go abroad? Among those who are interested in overseas study, nearly 50 percent want to have fun traveling and exploring different cultures, while 30 percent want to work for an international company and live overseas. About 15 percent said they wanted to go to the best university and get the best education offered worldwide. What's more, the high cost of UK university studies plays a role in over half of students' interest in overseas study.

{"question": "The water level of oceans rises and falls alternately twice a day. This movement of water is called the tide. Tides are causer by the pull of the sun and the moon on the earth' s surface; since the moon is closer, it affects the tides more than the sun. When the moon is directly overhead, it actually pulls on the water that is below it. This causes the water level to rise because the water is pulled away from the earth. As the moon disappears over the horizon, the pull lessens and the water level settles back towards the ocean bottom. When the water reaches its highest level, we have high tide. And when the water comes to its lowest level, we have low tide from its lowest point, the water rises gradually for about six hours until it reaches high tide. Then it begins to fall continuously for about six hours until it reaches low tide. Then the cycle begins again.

{"question": "A third of 15 to 18-year-olds in the UK have met someone in person they originally met through social media. The figure comes from an exclusive online Newsbeat poll  of 1,015 British teenagers, put together by Comres. The survey also indicates that a quarter feel happier online than they do in real life. But overall, real-life relationships are still considered far more important than online ones, according to the findings. Sixty-six per cent polled last month said the number of friends they knew in person was more important to them, compared to 28% who said the same of the number of friends and followers they had online. The survey also suggests what lots of people know already, that social media is now an integral part of teenagers' lives. Only one per cent of _ said they never checked in online for social reasons. Facebook is the most popular social network (89% have an account), followed by Twitter (62%) and Snapchat (58%). Dr Emma Short, a psychologist at the University of Bedfordshire, said, \"The number of teenagers meeting up with people they first befriended online is worrying. Even very sophisticated security experts find it very hard to verify the identity of accounts. When you're 15 and you're very effective at identifying friends and risk, it's easy to assume you can do that online. It's not safe in that they may not be who they say they are and you know nothing about them apart from the conversation you've had online - which is a very small part of their lives and the person they may be.\" The survey also indicated: * 25% of teenagers admitted they were addicted to social media. * 25% wished they could give up social media. \"I can't do without my phone.\" says 17-year-old Aisha from Clapton, north London. \"I can't do without checking Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat.\" When we ask Aisha about the prospect of taking her social networks away, the consequences, genuinely, are too hard to bear.

{"question": "According to a new study by Israel researchers from University of Haifa, posting blogs to express feelings and emotions is _ for children aged 13-17. Psychology professors Meyran Boniel-Nissim and Azy Barak have found that a teenager writing a publicly-viewed blog on the Internet is more effective for relieving stress rather than keeping a private diary. The study, published in the journalPsychological Services, supports that expressing oneself through writing can be therapeutic. To conduct the research, Boniel-Nissim and Barak randomly selected Israeli high school students who displayed a certain degree of stress. The teenagers were then divided into six groups. Two groups were asked to post blogs twice a week about their social difficulties, but only one of them was asked to open the blogs for comments. The next set of groups were also asked to blog twice a week to post about whatever was going on in their mind, again with one group allowing comments. The two control groups were asked to keep an old-fashioned private diary. The researchers then collected the blog posts and diaries to discuss the adolescents' emotional and social position. From the research, they saw that the greatest improvement in mood was with the bloggers who wrote about their personal troubles and allowed people to interact with their posts. The research also noted that the comments were mostly positive and constructive. Boniel-Nissim and Barak said that the commentators' interactions helped the bloggers while they were distressed.

{"question": "It would be pleasant to believe that all young girls in the past got married for romantic reasons; but the fact is that many of them regarded marriage as their only chance to gain independence from their parents, to have a provider, or to be assured of a good place in society. A couple of generations ago, an old maid of twenty-five did not have much to look forward to, she was more or less fated to remain with her parents or to live in some relative's home where she would help with the chores and the children. Not so any more. In the first place, women remain young much longer than they used to, and an unmarried woman of twenty-eight or thirty does not feel that her life is over. Besides, since she is probably working and supporting herself, she is free to marry only when and if she chooses. As a result, today's women tend  to marry later in life. They have fewer children-or none at all--if they prefer to devote themselves to their profession. The result is a decline in the birthrate. The new role that women have developed for themselves has changed family life. Children are raised differently; they spend more time with adults who are not their parents: baby sitters, day-care center personnel, relatives, or neighbors. Whether they gain or lose in the process is a hotly debated question. Some child experts believe that young children must spend all their time with their mother if they are to grow sound in body and mind. Others think that children get more from a mother who spends with them \"quality time\" (a time of fun and relaxation set aside for them) rather than hours of forced and unhappy baby sitting. And many child psychologists point out that children kept in day-care centers every day are brighter than those raised at home.

{"question": "Many critics worry about violence on television, most out of fear that it stimulates viewers to violent or aggressive acts. Our research, however, indicates that the consequences of experiencing TV's symbolic world of violence may be much more far-reaching. We have found that people who watch a lot of TV see the real world as more dangerous and frightening than those who watch very little. Heavy viewers are less trustful of their fellow citizens, and more fearful of the real world. Since most TV \"action-adventure\" dramas occur in urban settings, the fear they inspire may contribute to the current flee of the middle class from our cities. The fear may also bring increasing demands for police protection, and election of law-and-order politicians. While none of us is completely dependent upon television for our view of the world, neither have many of us had the opportunity to observe the reality of police stations, courtrooms, corporate board rooms, or hospital operating rooms. Although critics complain about the fixed characters and plots of TV dramas, many viewers look on them as representative of the real world. Anyone who questions that statement should read the 250,000 letters, most containing requests for medical advice, sent by viewers to \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\" --a popular TV drama series about a doctor-- during the first five years of his practice on TV. Violence on television leads viewers to regard the real world as more dangerous than it really is, which must also influence the way people behave. When asked, \"Can most people be trusted?\" the heavy viewers were 35 percent more likely to choose \"Can't be too careful.\" Victims, like criminals, must learn their proper roles, and televised violence may perform the teaching function all too well. Instead of worrying only about whether television violence causes individual displays of aggression in the real world, we should also be concerned about social reality. Passive acceptance of violence in the face of injustice may result from far greater social concern than occasional displays of individual aggression. We have found that violence on prime-time network TV cultivates overstated  assumptions about the threat of danger in the real world. Fear is a universal emotion, and easy to exploit. The overstated sense of risk and insecurity may lead to increasing demands for protection and to increasing pressure for the use of force by established authority. Instead of threatening the social order, television may have become our chief instrument of social control. According to the passage, why did \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\" receive so many letters?", "subject": "social sciences", "choices": "['Because viewers believed the doctor did exist in the real life.'\n 'Because certain TV programmes recommended him to viewers.'\n 'Because he was an experienced doctor and saved many lives.'\n 'Because the TV appealed to people to pay attention to health.']", "answer": "0"}

Don't get to your parents when you are angry.Your parents probably won't consider your ideas if you are shouting at them. And you can't express yourself well if you are angry. Go to someplace to cool off  . Make sure you understand why you are unhappy. Then think about what you want to say to your parents.

You can keep your disagreement and try your best to accept each other. Michael's mother didn't agree with him about buying a motorcycle. They argued over it. But they finally came to a compromise. Michael bought the motorcycle, but only drove it on certain days. Of course, your parents might refuse to compromise on something .

{"question": "The best and worst part about being a twenty-something is that every decision you make can change the rest of your life. Once you're in your 30's or 40's, it gets harder and harder to reinvent yourself. So I made an interview with Dr. Meg Jay, the clinical psychologist. He explains why the twenties matter, and how to make the most of them.  In Dr. Meg Jay's opinion, our 20s are the  _ decade of adulthood. 80% of life's most important moments take place by about age 35. And 2/3 of lifetime wage growth happens during the first ten years of a career. More than half of Americans are married or are dating or living with their future partner by age 30. Personality can change more during our 20s than at any other decade in life. Female fertility  peaks at 28. The brain caps off   its last major growth. When it comes to adult development, 30 is not the new 20. Even if you do nothing, not making choices is a choice all the same. Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do. On the other hand, I also ask him how the 20s track their progress toward their future goals and whether milestones like 21 and 30 are really important. Dr. Meg Jay think it  ly important. Milestones--21, 25, 30, New Year's, birthdays, reunions--are important because they cause self-reflection. What he mentioned are as follows: Am I where I wanted to be by this age? Did I do what I said I would do this year? If not, why not. And if not now, when? A 20-year-old girl who interviewed me recently told me about a question she was advised to ask herself as she moved through adulthood: \"If you keep living your life exactly as it is, where will you be in 3 years?\" If you don't like the answer, now is the time to change course.

{"question": "The income gap between China's rural and urban residents  has continued to widen during the past few years in spite of rapidly rising rural incomes, Agricultural Minister Sun Zhengcai said here on Wednesday. The income ratio  between urban and rural residents was 3.28:1 in 2006, against 3.23:1 in 2003, said Sun in his report on the promotion of building a new countryside in 2007. Sun also said the net income of rural residents in different regions also varied widely. The income gap is only one of several problems in rural areas, according to Sun's report. While listing the achievements in rural areas in recent years, Sun believed that rural development still followed behind urban development. \"We have bigger pressure to ensure the supply of major agricultural products such as grain,\" he said. \"China's urbanization  has been speeded up and more rural residents have gone to urban areas,\" he said. \"In this case, more agricultural producers become farm produce consumers, which created more pressure for supply,\" he said. Another problem facing China's agricultural development is _ application of science and technology. \"Only 30 percent of scientific and technological achievements have been applied to agricultural production, which is 40 percentage points lower than developed countries,\" he said. Despite increased government spending in rural areas, the infrastructure  is still poor and easily hit by disasters. According to Sun, the government spent 431.8 billion yuan ($59.15 billion) on agriculture, rural areas and farmers this year, an increase of 80.1 billion yuan over the previous year. China set aside 11.38 billion yuan to promote a new rural cooperative medical care system and 27.98 billion yuan to support the new compulsory education mechanism in rural area to ensure that all citizens shared the fruits of China's reform and opening-up, Sun said.

{"question": "Why does most of the world travel on the right side today? Theories differ, but there's no doubt that Napoleon was a major influence. The French had used the right since at least the late 18th century. Some say that before the French Revolution, noblemen drove their carriages on the left, forcing the peasants to the right. Regardless of the origin, Napoleon brought right-hand traffic to the nations he conquered, including Russia, Switzerland and Germany. Hitler, in turn, ordered right-hand traffic in Czechoslovakia and Austria in the 1930s. Nations that escaped right-hand control, like Great Britain, followed their left-hand tradition. The U.S. has not always been a nation of right-hand rivers; earlier in its history, carriage and horse traffic traveled on the left, as it did in England. But by the late 1700s, people driving large wagons pulled by several pairs of horses began promoting a shift to the right. A driver would sit on the rear   left horse in order to wave his whip with his right hand; to see opposite traffic clearly, they traveled on the right. One of the final moves to firmly standardize traffic directions in the U.S. occurred in the 20th century, when Henry Ford decided to mass-produce his cars with controls on the left (one reason, stated in 1908; the convenience for passengers exiting directly onto the edge, especially... if there is a lady to be considered). Once these rules were set, many countries eventually adjusted to the right-hand standard, including Canada in the 1920s, Sweden in 1967 and Burma in 1970. The U.K. and former colonies such as Australia and India are among the western world's few remaining holdouts. Several Asian countries, including Japan, use the left as well -- thought many places use both right-hand-drive and left-hand-drive cars.

{"question": "While most high school students spend most of their time worrying about who  likes who, and different relationships between their classmates, I choose to focus on my school lessons and sports.  When I was young, my mother encouraged me to develop and keep friendship with boys in order to build strong relationships. But she told me not to risk a good friendship with a boy with the title of boyfriend. It' s indeed a wise choice to stay friends with those of the opposite sex. In my opinion, even though some high school relationship might continue after graduation, the probability of them lasting much longer is so slim that there really is not a point to it.  Firstly you have to think about such a question-- whether it is possible to hurt both of you, or even hurt both of your future husbands or wives. My second point is that you still can date if you hope marriage could possibly follow. Except this, there really is not any other reason for dating. Some students desire relationships for a chance to be romantic. While these are nice to have, there are many more important things at this point in our lives.  The titles of boyfriend and girlfriend put too much stress on a relationship between high school students. Just staying as common friends may be the best choice for us. I strongly recommend we should deal with it in an appropriate way and follow our teachers' advice if necessary.

{"question": "Pacing and Pausing Sara tried to befriend her old friend Steve's new wife, but Betty never seemed to have anything to say. While Sara felt Betty didn't hold up her end of the conversation, Betty complained to Steve that Sara never gave her a chance to talk. The problem had to do with expectations about pacing and pausing. Conversation is a turn-taking game. When our habits are similar, there's no problem. But if our habits are different, you may start to talk before I'm finished or fail to take your turn when I'm finished. That's what was happening with Betty and Sara. It may not be coincidental that Betty, who expected relatively longer pauses between turns, is British, and Sara, who expected relatively shorter pauses, is American. Betty often felt interrupted by Sara. But Betty herself became an interrupter and found herself doing most of the talking when she met a visitor from Finland. And Sara had a hard time cutting in on some speakers from Latin America or Israel. The general phenomenon, then, is that the small conversation techniques, like pacing and pausing, lead people to draw conclusions not about conversational style but about personality and abilities. These habitual differences are often the basis for dangerous stereotyping  . And these social phenomena can have very personal consequences. For example, a woman from the southwestern part of the US went to live in an eastern city to take up a job in personnel. When the Personnel Department got together for meetings, she kept searching for the right time to break in -- and never found it. Although back home she was considered outgoing and confident, in Washington she was viewed as shy and retiring. When she was evaluated at the end of the year, she was told to take a training course because of her inability to speak up. That's why slight differences in conversational style -- tiny little things like microseconds of pause -- can have a great effect on one's life. The result in this cause was a judgment of psychological problems -- even in the mind of the woman herself, who really wondered what was wrong with her and registered for _ training.

{"question": "What is your favorite color? Do you like yellow, orange, and red? If you do, you must be an optimist , a leader, an active person who enjoys life, people and excitement. Do you prefer grays and blues? Then you are probably quiet, shy and you would rather follow than lead. If you love green, you are strong-minded and determined. You wish to succeed and want other people to see you are successful. At least this is what psychologists tell us, and they should know, because they have been seriously studying the meaning of color preference , and the effect that colors have on human beings. They tell us that we don't choose our favorite color as we grow up. If you happen to love brown, you did so as soon as you opened your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly. A yellow room makes us feel more cheerful and more comfortable than a dark green one, and a red dress rings warmth and cheer to the saddest winter day. On the other hand, black is depressing . Light and bright colors make people not only happier but more active. It is a fact that factory workers work better, harder, and have fewer accidents when their machines are painted orange rather than black or dark gray. Remember, then, that if you feel low, you can always brighten your day or your life with a new shirt or a few colorful things.

{"question": "At age 11, Ghulam was married off to 40-year-old Jaiz in a rural Afghan village, making her only one of more than 10 million young girls who are being forced to wed men old enough to be their fathers of grandfather every year. In an effort to start a global conversation about the devastating effects of early marriages, which are currently practiced in more than 50 developing countries, the United Nations designed October 11 as International Day of the Girl Child this year. Although child marriage is against the law in many countries, and international treaties forbid the practice, it is estimated that about 51 million girls below age 18 are currently married, often under the cover of darkness and in secret. In Afghanistan alone, it is believed that approximately 57 percent of girls wed before the legal age of 16. Various factors drive parents of child bridges to marry off their daughters, from the community's pressure to confirm to age-old cultural customs to economic considerations. In poor, developing nations, it is not uncommon for families to settle debts by offering their daughters as payment. Experts agree that early marriage denies the girl education and robs them of their childhood because most young wives, burdened by grownup responsibilities, do not get a chance to interact with their peers or carry on friendships outside the household. In many cases, the girls are lorded over by their husbands and in-laws, leaving them vulnerable  to domestic violence as well as physical, sexual and verbal abuse. Underage wives who are lucky enough to escape from their husbands end up living in poverty, or worse. Most girls who enter early marriages are expected to get pregnant right away, which often leads to tragedy for both the mothers, who are still children themselves, and their babies. Unless international organizations take steps to reverse the troubling trend, it is estimated that over the next decade, 100 million more girls--or about 25,000 girls a day ---will marry before they turn 18.

{"question": "By now, we are all aware that social media has had a tremendous influence on our culture, in business, on the world-at-large. Social media websites revolutionized the way people communicate and socialize on the Web. However, aside from seeing your friends' new baby on Facebook, or reading about Justin Bieber's latest conflict with the law on Twitter, what are some of the real influences? Social networks offer the opportunity for people to re-connect with their old friends and acquaintances, make new friends, share ideas and pictures, and many other activities. Users can keep pace with the latest global and local developments, and participate in campaigns and activities of their choice. Professionals use social media sites like LinkedIn to enhance their career and business development. Students can work together with their peers to improve their academic and communication skills. Unfortunately, there are a few downsides too to social networking. If you are not careful, immoral people can target you for cyber bullying and disturbance on social sites. School children, young girls, and women can fall victim to online attacks which can create tension and suffering. If you are a victim of cyber bullying, do not take it lying down, but try to take appropriate legal action against the attacker. Many companies have blocked social networks as addicted employees can distract themselves on such sites, instead of focusing on work. In fact, studies show that British companies have lost billions of dollars per year in productivity because of social media addiction among employees. Also, what you carelessly post on the Net can come back to trouble you. Revealing( ) personal information on social sites can make users vulnerable to crimes like identity theft, stalking, etc. Many companies perform a background check on the Web before hiring an employee. If a potential employee has posted something embarrassing on social media, it can greatly affect their chances of getting the job. The same holds true for our relationships too, as our loved ones and friends may get to know if we post something undesirable on social networks.

{"question": "The world's population is more mobile  today than ever before. In 2010, more than 200 million people left their home countries to live in a new country. This is about 3 percent of the total world population. Some experts believe that number will swell to 400 million by 2050. Rates of immigration have remained strong for the last 300 years, but patterns of immigration have changed since World War II. The backgrounds and experiences of today's immigrants are different from those of the typical European immigrant of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Contemporary immigrants range from unskilled laborers to highly skilled professionals, and they come from and go to countries all over the world. In the nineteenth century and until World War II, immigration was primarily in one direction- from the Old World to the New World. This is no longer the case. Countries such as Russia and China, which have long been, and continue to be, significant source countries, are now also destination countries. There is also considerable mobility inside regions, such as from one European country to another, or among the countries of the former Soviet Union. In spite of such differences, the push and pull factors for immigration remain essentially the same as they were 100 years ago. Most people move to another country because they want a better life. For the majority of immigrants, this means better economic conditions. As in past generations, a labor shortage in one country often draws workers from another country, especially if wages are significantly higher. In some small countries, for example, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, there are more jobs than citizens. The demand for labor is so high that the majority of the population consists of foreign-born workers, ranging from highly skilled engineers and financial experts to domestic and construction workers. In traditional destination countries, such as the United States, however, labor needs have changed. Today, although there is still demand for unskilled labor, there is increasing demand for people with a high level of skill and education. The need for less skilled labor has shifted to other countries. As work on farms and in industry in the United States and Canada once drew workers from all over the world, now work in factories in Taiwan and south Korea attracts workers from Vietnam, the Philippines, and Cambodia. Most global immigration is legal: however, a large number of people also move across national borders illegally in pursuit of employment. Experts estimate that about 15 to 20 percent of immigrants worldwide are in their new countries illegally. The United States has the largest number of these immigrants, followed by South Africa, with significant numbers also in Northern and Western Europe and Mexico. These immigrants face particular challenges because they often must hide from the authorities who might deport them back to their home countries. Their illegal status also means that employers may take advantage of them by forcing them to work longer hours and paying them less than the legal minimum wage. Although economics remains the most important motivation in all forms of immigrant, other factors are also important. Some people decide to leave their home countries because their actions or political beliefs make it dangerous for them to remain. Others choose to leave because their home country has become too dangerous and unstable, often because of war or political unrest. They wish to find a place that is secure for themselves and their families. Education is also a significant factor for many modern immigrants. They want to raise their children in a place where they can get a good education, which, in turn, they hope will provide them with better prospects for the future. Finally, family and community ties also play a role in immigration decisions. As in the past, once a group of people from one country establishes a community in a new country, more people from that country is likely to follow. The pattern, direction, and rate of immigration may change as the global economy changes. However, as long as life in a new country is more attractive than life in the old country, immigration will continue.
