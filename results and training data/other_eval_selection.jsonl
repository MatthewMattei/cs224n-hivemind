{"question": "Hello Sandy, We have just returned from our holiday. We went with our friends Edward Smith and his wife Tina to the Yorkshire Moors. This is a beautiful place. It is a natural park. There are lots of places to walk on the tops of the hills, miles of grassland with no people, just sheep and birds. Edward, who had just come out of hospital, could not walk as far as be used to. However this meant that we walked in the mornings, and then stopped at a cafe for lunch each day, before returning to the place we live. Edward and I slept in front of the fire all afternoon, while the ladies went for another walk. Very pleasant! I have taken lots of photos from the place we live, across the valley below us, of the morning sunrise, and the mist in the valley. Also, in England, the old steam powered trains are very popular. I have taken many photos of the train and from it. Yesterday we had the first snow of this winter. It is very early (we usually expect snow in January). It rained all day, then snowed in the evening. Today we have bright sunshine! Both Jenny and I are well I don't know if I told you, in the last e-mail, that Jenny is now working in a hotel.

{"question": "For many people today, reading is no longer relaxation. To keep up with their work they must read letters, reports, trade publications, interoffice communications: a never-ending flood of words. In getting a job or advancing in one, the ability to read and comprehend quickly can mean the difference between success and failure. Yet the unfortunate fact is that most of us are poor readers. Most reading faults can be traced to early school training. According to Dr. Betts, two persons out of five in school were forced to read material too difficult for them to understand at the time, a frustration experience which left them with bad reading habits. Fortunately, almost anyone can learn to read faster and with more comprehension. Age makes little difference. According to a recent study of 138 students at The Reading Laboratory, Inc. , all age groups showed a marked increase in reading rate after training from 93 percent for the 50-90 age group to 142 percent for the 20-29.Dr. Mila Banton Smith, director of New York University's Reading Institute, says that the average adult student, in 28 training hours, nearly triples   his reading speed and boosts  his comprehension by about 30 percent. The best way to improve your reading, of course, is to enroll  in a reading clinic. If there's no clinic handy, you can improve your reading ability yourself--- provided you have no eyes troubles.

{"question": "The Age of Unreason Charles Handy In his book The Age of Unreason Professor Handy describes the dramatic changes that are taking place in our lives today and warns that we must adapt to these changes if we want to survive in the future. Handy believes that in the future less than 50% of the workforce will be employed full-time by an organization. These full-time employees will be the qualified professionals, technicians, and managers who are essential to an organization. Their working lives will be a lot more demanding than today, but in return they will be well-paid and they will retire earlier. The rest of the workforce will be self-employed or will work part-time, providing organizations with the products and services they require on a contract basis. Handy forecasts a big increase in the number of working mothers in the future and believes there will be a large number of unemployed. Handy gives us plenty of figures to worry about. He estimates that by the year 2040, one person in five will retire, and one in ten will be over seventy-five years old. There will be one retiree to every three people of working age, and even more than that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, where the proportion will be as much as one to two. Retirees will remain healthy and active for longer than they do today and many will live to be a hundred years old, a fact which leads Handy to suggest that the term retirement will no longer be appropriate. He suggests the third age is a more appropriate description, since it will be as important a part of our lives as the first age of learning and the second age of working are for us today.

{"question": "Mark Ramirez, a senior executive at AOL, could work in the comfortable leather chair, if he wanted. No, thanks. He prefers to stand most of the day at a desk raised above stomach level. \"I've got my knees bent. I feel totally alive,\" he said. \"It feels more natural to stand.\" In the past few years, standing has become the new sitting for 10 percent of AOL employees at the firm's Virginia branch. Part of a standing popularity is among accountants, programmers, telemarketers and other office workers across the nation. GeekDesk, a California firm that sells desks raised by electric motors, says sales will triple this year. Standers give various reasons for taking to their feet: It makes them feel more focused, prevents drowsiness , and makes them feel like a general even if they just push paper. (Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfels works standing up. So does novelist Philip Roth.) But unknown to them, a debate   is spreading among ergonomics experts  and public-health researchers about whether all office workers should be encouraged to stand--to save lives. Doctors point to surprising new research showing higher rates of diabetes, obesity, heart disease and even mortality among people who sit for long stretches. A study earlier this year in theAmerican Journal of Epidemiologyshowed that among 123,000 adults followed over 14 years, those who sat more than six hours a day were at least 18 percent more likely to die during the time period studied than those who sat less than three hours a day. \"Every rock we turn over when it comes to sitting is astonishing,\" said Marc Hamilton, a leading researcher on inactivity physiology at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana. \"Sitting is harmful. It's dangerous. We are on the cusp   of a major revolution.\" He calls sitting \"the new smoking\". Not so fast, other experts say. Standing too much at work will cause more long-term back injuries. Incidences of varicose veins  among women will increase. The heart will have to pump more. Hedge, the Cornell professor, isn't a fan of all this standing. \"Making people stand all day is dumb,\" he said. The sensible and most cost-effective strategy , he said, is to sit in a neutral posture , slightly reclined , with the keyboard on a tray above the lap. This position promotes positive blood flow. Workers should occasionally walk around, stretch and avoid prolonged periods at the desk. The key, he said, is movement, not standing.

{"question": "Werewolves   aren't the only creatures  affected by the moon's cycles. A full moon slightly affects people's sleep, reports a Swiss team of scientists. Even people's sleep in a lab without windows experienced a small shortfall in sleep once a month. To test the moon's effect, 33 adult volunteers of both sexes and various ages spent several nights in a sleep lab. As they slept, researchers recorded their brain activity, eye movements and hormone   levels. On nights closer to a full moon, the subjects took an average of five minutes longer to fall asleep, and slept for 20 minutes less. In addition, brain activity decreased by 30 percent during the sleep stage that the brain normally uses to recover from its daylight work. And levels of hormone that help control sleep cycles dropped. On these nights, the sleepers complained of poor sleep quality even though they were unaware of the moon's cycle. On the bright side, not a single participant turned into a werewolf. The Swiss team doesn't know how the moon affects sleep. The gravity   of the moon causes ocean tides to rise and fall. But that force is too weak to affect sleep, Gajochen says. He believed some body's biological clock may be tied to the moon cycles. There may be another explanation, says David Dinges.

The answer is easy. There are exactly hundreds of kinds of cold viruses there. You never know which one you will get, so there isn't a cure for each one. When a virus attacks your body, the body works hard to get rid of it. Blood rushes to your nose and brings congestion with it .You feel terrible because you can't breathe well, but your body is actually \"eating\" the virus. Your temperature rises and you get a fever, but the heat of your body is killing the virus. You also have a running nose to stop the virus from getting to your cells.  You may feel miserable, but actually your wonderful body is doing everything it can to kill the cold. Different people have different remedies for colds. In the United States and sane other countries, for example, people might eat chicken soup to feel better. Some people take hot baths and drink warm liquids.  Other people take medicine to stop the fever, congestion, and running nose. There is one interesting thing to note - some scientists say taking medicines when you have a cold is actually bad for you.

Students at Fudan University have even formed a Mahjong club. This resurgence of the game, however, is not without its critics. Some people still associate the game with gambling and for many years Mahjong was banned in China. One critic, surnamed Meng, was quoted as saying, \"Mahjong is a bad custom that will distract students from studies.\" But Yu Guangyuan, former vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , says Mahjong is a \"healthy, scientific, friendly mind game.\" Mr. Yu's opinion seems to be shared by the majority of Chinese. They see the game as an activity that requires great concentration and intellectual skill. They also see the game as an important part of Chinese culture and a pastime that brings family and friends closer together. This Spring Festival many families will no doubt spend hours around the Mahjong table getting reacquainted with each other. For them, playing Mahjong is a way of spending quality family time. No one knows who invented Mahjong. Some say it was Confucius, others say the current form of the game was developed right here in Shanghai in the late19th century. It is certainly because of Shanghai that the game enjoys its worldwide popularity. It was brought to America in the 1920s and has since spread throughout Europe and other parts of Asia. There is now a World Championship of Mahjong which is held every year. This year's championship was held in Chongqing and attracted players from America, Europe and Russia, as well as students from Peking University, Tshinghua University and Nankai University. There was no prize money, but the players delighted in using their wits and their understanding of statistics and probability theory to defeat their clever opponents. Of course, Mahjong doesn't have to always be that intense. For young people it can be a way to relax and to socialize, a chance to get away from their computers and talk to other people face to face.

{"question": "When I was a kid, I never had any problems watching some cartoons. It was so much fun and a great education  too. Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Tom and Jerry were my idols . Even now I really feel that they are worth watching at any age. The problem I've found is the cartoons at present. Some of them contain something ugly. Most of the time, they show such many terrible characters with violence that you wonder what they really mean. Cartoons are supposed to be funny but they aren't. If you are expecting to teach your kids good manners and behavior, then they are the worst for your kids to watch. Kids often imitate what they see in cartoons. If your kid is a fan of such cartoons, he or she will follow his or her favorite cartoon character and try to do something extremely dangerous.

How do the blind take their photographs? Some rely on assistants to set up and then describe the shots   , and others just point and shoot in the right place.\"Just like any good artists,\" says McCulloh.\"They have their unique ways of operating.\" One participating photographer is Pete Eckert, an artist with multiple degrees in design and sculpture who only turned to photography after losing his vision in the mid-1990s.He opens the shutter   on his camera and then uses flashlights, lights, and candles to paint his scene on film.A former fashion photographer in Chicago, Weston, lost his vision due to AIDS in 1996 and focuses on images of destruction and disability.His photos are also a star of the show. What do gallery-goers say? \"I was very impressed by it.The technique and experience was amazingly different,\" says John Hesketh, a printmaker in Anaheim.\"You never have a sense of feeling sorry for these people because they've worked very hard to prove their value.\" Beyond the praise, however, the exhibition also makes a great example for disabled people everywhere.That point was explained in early May during a discussion on the TV show.At the very end of the talk, one attendee expressed his opinion.\"This exhibition is extraordinary and revolutionary for many reasons.I think that by being an artist with a disability, you are continuing the work of those people who fought for basic civil rights to gain access and to have a voice.In that way, it's so wonderful that your photographs say it all.\" From the passage we know that some blind people take photos by  _  .", "subject": "other", "choices": "['describing the things to their assistants.'\n 'holding the camera and shooting randomly.'\n 'opening the shutter with the help of others.'\n 'using special equipment designed for them.']", "answer": "1"}

{"question": "The spread of Western eating habits around the world is bad for human health and the environment. These findings come from a new report in the journal Nature. David Tillman, a professor of ecology at the University of Minnesota, America, examined information from 100 countries to identify what people ate and how diet affected health. He noted a movement beginning in the 1960s. He found that as nations industrialized, population increased and earnings rose, more people began to adopt  what has been called the Western diet. The Western diet is high in sugar, fat, oil and meat. By eating these foods, people began to get fatter and sicker. David Tillman says overweight people are at greater risk for non-infectious diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Unfortunately when people become industrialized, if they adopt this Western diet, they are going to have these health problems, especially in developing countries in Asia. China is an example where the number of diabetes cases has been jumping from less than one percent to 10 percent of the population as they began to industrialize over a 20-year period. And that is happening all across the world, in Mexico, in Nigeria and so on. And, a diet bad for human beings, is also bad for the environment. As the world's population grows, more forests and tropical areas will become farmland for crops or grasslands for cattle. We are likely to have more greenhouse gas in the future from agriculture than that coming out of all forms of transportation right now.

{"question": "I first came across the concept of pay-what-you-can cafes last summer in Boone, N.C., where I ate at F.A.R.M (Feed All Regardless of Means) Cafe. You can volunteer to earn your meal, pay the suggested price($10) or less, or you can overpay--paying it forward for a future customer's meal. My only regret after eating there was not having a chance to give my time. So as soon as Healthy World Cafe opened in York in April, I signed up for a volunteer shift . F.A.R.M and healthy World are part of a growing trend of community cafes. In 2003, Denise Cerreta opened the first in Salt Lake City. Cerreta now runs the One World Everybody Eats Foundation, helping others copy her pay-what-you can model. \"I think the community cafe is truly a hand up, not a handout,\" Cerreta said. She acknowledged that soup kitchens  have a place in society, but people typically don't feel good about going there. \"One of the values of the community cafe is that we have another approach,\" she said. \"Everyone eats here, no one needs to know whether you volunteered, overpaid or underpaid.\" The successful cafes not only address hunger and food insecurity but also become necessary parts of their neighborhood -- whether it's a place to learn skills or hear live music. Some teach cooking to seniors; some offer free used books. Eating or working there is a reminder that we are all in this world together. My 10 am-1pm shift at World-Healthy-Cafe began with the cafe manager -- one of the two paid staff members. Our volunteer crew wasn't the most orderly, but we managed to prepare and serve meals with a lot of laughs in between.

{"question": "You might be thinking about entering healthcare as a second career but are having lots of doubts, primarily because you feel that the time and energy you invested in your profession might just go to waste. On the contrary, many of the skills and strengths you need in healthcare, particularly in the nursing field, are strengths and skills that you most likely have developed already in your professional career, especially if you worked in a high-pressure office setting or any form of customer service. In healthcare, you will be communicating face-to-face with people on a daily basis --- nurses, doctors, patients, family of patients, and so on. In fact, when you are working, you will probably be getting instructions from someone, relaying  a message, soothing the worries of a patient, explaining circumstances, and so on. To have strong communication skills, you need to be able to speak clearly and listen carefully. It is important that the messages you deliver are accurate and brief, not only orally but also literally --- documentation is part of the job. In most professions, communication skills are also highly valued and developed. Writing memos, speaking and listening in meetings, and understanding nonverbal and verbal cues  are all helpful and transferable to a health career. For professionals with a background in psychology, counseling, teaching, social work, public speaking, customer service, and any job that teaches empathy, they might find that they fit well in a nursing job or a job in healthcare. Having empathy is vital to becoming an effective nurse. Good nurses tend to be empathetic, sympathetic, understand different cultures, respect teamwork, and listen well. For those who worked in customer service such as working as a salesperson, waitstaff, or receptionist, they will find that there are a lot of characteristics that they learned from the job and that they can transfer to working in healthcare.

While others had Cokes and candy for lunch, I had to eat a sandwich. As you can guess, my supper was different from other kids' too. But at least I wasn't alone in my sufferings. My sister and two brothers had the same mother as I did.               My mother insisted upon knowing where we were at all times. She had to know who our friends were and where we were going. She insisted if we said we'd be gone an hour, then we be gone one hour or less---not one hour and one minute. And she always insisted upon us telling the truth. Now you can see how mean she was.               The worst is yet to come. We had to be in bed by nine each night and up at eight the next morning. We had to wash the dishes, make beds, and learn to cook. We had to wear clean clothes and take a bath, while the other kids always wore their clothes for days.

{"question": "Invisible ink has fascinated kids for generations. You might think that it would be difficult to make, but it's not. All you'll need for this experient is some milk; some white paper; a clean cotton swab   or small, clean paintbrush; the kitchen stove; and help from an adult. The most difficult part of this mini-project is choosing the message that you'll write with your invisible ink. Maybe you'll want to pretend that you're a spy on a secret mission, writing messages that would lead to big, big trouble if they were discovered. Choose your words carefully. All you need to do is, using the brush of cotton swab, write your message with milk on the paper. Don't use a lot of milk and soak the paper. Use just enough to make a thin coating. Once you've finished writing, ask the adult who's helping you to turn on the kitchen stove to a low heat. Very carefully, using kitchen mitts ,hold the paper about a foot above the warm burner. If you don't see results, you may have to make the burner a little hotter. Do not, however, hold the paper low over the burner. As the paper heats up, your message will become brown and you'll be able to see what was written. You want to know why? It's because chemical compounds in the milk have a low burning point. When the paper gets warm, those compounds will heat up and trun brown, while the paper will be unaffected. You also can try this experiment with other liquids, such as orange juice, lemon juice, vinegar, and apple juice. Just be sure to follow all safety rules and have an adult around to help you.

{"question": "Over the years, Americans have become used to salt.Most people have no idea how much salt they consume-on average, about 9 to 12 gram per person per day, according to the American Heart Association.That's twice the amount recommended by the government. A new study last week showed eating even a little less salt could greatly help the heart.The scientists said the results would be thirteen percent fewer heart attacks, eight percent fewer strokes , four percent fewer deaths and eleven percent fewer new cases of heart disease. Researchers also found that the benefits would be greatest for African Americans and women.As a group, African Americans tend to have higher blood pressure than the general population, and \"many studies suggest that they may be more sensitive to salt,\" says Dr.Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco.Her analysis found that a reduction of 3 gram of salt per day would reduce heart attacks 8% on average; among African Americans, that rate would drop 10%.A similar result was found in women, whose stroke risk dropped 8% with a 3-g reduction in salt intake; in men, the risk fell 5%. They and public health professionals in the United States are interested in a national campaign to persuade people to eat less salt. However, other scientists say such a campaign is an experiment with the health of millions of people. Michael Alderman, a high blood pressure expert and professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, says that eating less salt results in lower blood pressure.But he says studies have not clearly shown that lowering salt means fewer heart attacks or strokes. \"Salt has other biological effects.

{"question": "In a recent class I was asked \"What is a short story?\" My first answer was that it was something that could be read in one sitting and brought an illumination to the reader, sudden and golden like sunlight cracking(, ) through a heavy cloud. I went on to say that in my opinion a \"real\" short story was closer to poetry than to a novel. Here are some definitions of the short story. My favorite is Benet's: \"something that can be read in an hour and remembered for a lifetime\". One writer said, \"The theme of a novel won't fit into the framework of a short story; It's like trying to squeeze a large painting done on a wall into the frame of a miniature  .  And as in a miniature painting, the details need to be sharp. \" The short story is an example of one aspect of human nature. Often a character _ some event, something that offers him or her change. This is why it's said that short stories usually \"say something \", often a small something, but sometimes delivered with such accuracy that the effect is strongly felt, even a life-moment for some readers, something similar to a religious experience or to witnessing a never-to-be-repeated scene in nature. Ok, let's form a definition here: A short story is an account, rarely over 10, 000 words or below 500 words-more commonly 1, 500 to 5, 000 words-a single-sitting read, but with enough time and weight to move the reader. It is narrow and focused to produce an effect through the story, most commonly through events affecting some change in an individual.

{"question": "More often than not, the person sitting next to you on a plane or sleeping in the next hotel room has paid more or less than you did for the same services. Each day, airlines give more than several hundred fares   for flights between the same two cities and hotels charge different rates for the same room. So how do you find the best rates? Here are some tips: ^ Sign up for fare special e-mails. When airlines get into a fare war, the cost of a plane ticket can fall overnight and the discounted fare may be sold out by noon the next day. Get on the mailing list of airlines and other travel Web sites so you can be told immediately if fares drop. ^ Buy your tickets at least 21 days in advance. There are usually four different timetables for advance tickets: 21-day, 14-day, 7-day, and 3-day. The further in advance you book your flight, the lower the fare you will find. ^ Consider another airport. Find out about all the airports that are near your destination city. You might be able to fly into a smaller airport or neighboring city at a much lower rate.     ^ Stay over a Saturday night. Airlines give the highest fares to business travelers, who fly during the week and spend their weekends at home. If you plan to leave for your trip on a Wednesday and return on Saturday, your fare would be a lot higher than you stay until Sunday morning.     ^ Fly on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. Some airlines offer cheaper fares on different days of the week. Generally, it's the cheapest to fly on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday. Remember, though, that a Saturday stay is necessary to receive the lowest rate.     ^ Pick a flight with plenty of open seats. Seats in a flight are divided into \"classes\", and each class has its own price. Since the cheapest classes sell first, the fewer seats that are left on a plane, the more expensive they are.

Even men who remember Dustin Hoffman struggling as a father in the movie may have a hard time answering questions ranging from baby food to politics. Tetsuya Ando, director of Fathering Japan, a Tokyo non-profit organization that came up with the test and will offer it to eager dads from next March, said the exam was an attracting way to get fathers into parenting. \"There just isn't enough information about parenting for fathers.

He recalled the flower garden, the swing his dad made, and the bike he had saved up for months to buy.  _ , for the brightness of those pictures hurt him, and his memory traveled on another ten years. He had a job by then, plenty of friends and started to come home less. He did not really want to remember those years, nor the day when, because of debts, he had gone home planning to ask for money. He felt embarrassed, but he knew exactly where his dad kept the money. When his parents stepped out of the room, he took what he wanted and left. That was the last time he had seen them. Ashamed, he went abroad, and his parents knew nothing about the years of wandering or time in prison. But locked in his cell he often thought of home. Once free, he would love to see his parents again, if they were still alive, and still wanted to see him. When his prison time was up, he found a job, but couldn't settle.

That evening he posted a letter which, although short, had taken him hours to write. It ended with: I know it is unreasonable of me to suppose you want to see me ... so it's up to you. I'll come early Thursday morning. If you want me home, hang a white handkerchief in the window of my old bedroom. If it's there, I'll come in; if not, I'll wave good-bye and go. And now it was Thursday morning and he was sitting on the pavement at the end of the street. Finally he got up and walked slowly toward the old house. He drew a long breath and looked.

{"question": "No one doubts that students should study languages, maths and science in high school, but some may be against the idea that they should study art and music as well. To them, these subjects are useless for students' future and are not worth the time and effort. In my opinion, however, it is necessary for middle school students to study art and music. Art and music are a valuable culture legacy , which bring us pleasure and enjoyment. Have you ever been deeply moved by Beethoven's famous Fifth Symphony? Have you ever been shocked by the colorful starry night produced by Vincent van Gogh in his paint? Have you ever longed for the moving love between the Butterfly Lovers when you hear this well-known Chinese melody ? Art and music are not only images and sounds, but something beyond them. They are the products of passion and human wisdom. Art and music help make students more creative. Artists and musicians are considered the most creative people in the world. It is because art and music sharpen their senses and provide a different perspective  for them to see the world. Many great scientists benefited from art and music. Einstein, the greatest physicist in the 20th century, as well as an excellent violin player, is a good example. Enjoying art and music is also a good way to relax ourselves. Middle school students, who typically carry heavy burdens of study, will definitely benefit from it. In a word, art and music should absolutely be included in the middle school courses, for they can bring students pleasure,creativity and relaxation.

{"question": "The standard Outward Bound course lasts for three or four weeks. During that time the students live in the wilderness and go through many physical activities of ever increasing difficulty. The first few days are given to physical conditioning and to the teaching of basic skills such as first aid, map and compass reading, rope climbing, and other similar activities. During the second part of the course students learn how to climb rocks and cliffs, how to use canoes and rafts in swift water, and in some schools how to sail, ski, climb mountains, and make long-distance hikes. The first two parts of the course are done in groups. Members work together and help each other to overcome the increasing number of challenges. In the third part of the course, students are sent out alone for three days to survive in the wilderness with only a few necessities. Who are the students of Outward Bound? They are both young people and adults, men and women. The minimum age is 16.5 years. There is no maximum age. About one-third of the 6,000 persons completing the course each year are women. Businessmen, housewives, university students, professors, doctors, and lawyers are among those taking part in the course. In recent years special courses for the busy business managers have gained in popularity. These courses last from five to ten days rather than the usual three to four weeks of the normal course. Not all students complete the Outward Bound course. In some cases the individual cannot meet the physical challenges. In its own words Outward Bound literature says: \"Make no mistake, Outward Bound is not for everybody. The courses aren't easy and are not meant to be.\" Most students who finish the course share a common experience.

{"question": "We live in a sweet world. The average American kid consumes more than 20 teaspoons of sugar per day, and adults eat 50% more sugar today than they did in the 1970s. We all know that too much sugar isn't good for you. But did we know it could be dangerous? A team of researchers at the University of Utah used mice to conduct a study on the negative effects of sugar. They found it could have serious effects on people's health. Sugar is found not only in sweets and candies, but also in many household items like pasta and crackers. During the 58-week-long study, mice were fed a diet containing 25% more sugar. This percentage equals a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily. The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice fed a similar diet without the sugar. Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure, male mice were 26% less territorial and produced 25% fewer offspring than the other mice. Scientists often use mice for research because they have a similar genetic  structure to humans. \"Since most substances that are dangerous in mice are also dangerous in people, it's likely that those physical problems that cause those mice to have increased deaths also work in people,\" says study author James Ruff of the University of Utah. Findings from this study reveal negative effects that are not as noticeable as weight gain or heart problems. Sugar can contribute to long-term changes in the body that can change development and even shorten lives. Cutting sugar out of the American diet altogether may be difficult. But making the effort to control our nation's sugar desire will provide for a truly sweeter future.

{"question": "The World Health Organization (WHO) planned to study the relationship between the eating habits of the people and the disease. Two doctors were chosen to make the study. They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries. They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa. The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor. The diseased children are usually from one to four years old. As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body. The skin changes color and may break out in open sores . The hair changes color and starts to fall out. The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time. Stomach liquids are no longer produced. The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat. Their mothers, after stopping their breastfeeding, gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins. They found that the addition of milk to the food of the children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives. The unbelievable thing about kwashiorkor is that the very existence of the disease--which has been killing thousands of children for centuries--was not even recognized in Latin America as recently as ten years ago. The deaths of those children were mistakenly listed as due to other diseases. It was the WHO's work in Africa that led to the discovery of the problem in Central America.

Researchers from the University of Essex, UK have found that as little as five minutes of a \"green activity\" such as walking, gardening, cycling or farming could help to improve mood and increase self-esteem  . Many studies have shown that outdoor exercise can reduce the risk of mental illness and improve a sense of well-being, but the new study, led by Jules Pretty and Jo Barton, was the first to determine how much time needed to be spent on green exercise for the benefits to show. Barton and Pretty looked at data from 1,252 people of different ages, genders   and mental health status   taken from 10 studies in Britain. They analyzed their different outdoor activities including walking, gardening, cycling, fishing, boating, horse-riding and farming in locations such as a park, garden or nature trail  . They found that the mental health changes were seen after just five minutes. With longer periods of time exercising in a green environment, the positive effects were more apparent. Looking at men and women of different ages, the researchers found the health changes were particularly strong in the young and the mentally ill. Green and blue A bigger effect was seen with exercise in an area that also contained water - such as a lake or river. \"This is because historically we are drawn to water to survive and it is in our genetic   make-up to be at one with nature,\" the researchers wrote in their report.

{"question": "Reading new peaks of popularity in North America is Iceberg Water which is harvested from icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. Arthur von Wiesenberger, who carries the title Water Master, is one of the few water critics in North America. As a boy, he spent time in the larger cities of Italy, France and Switzerland, Where bottled water is consumed daily. Even then, he kept a water journal, noting the brands he liked best. \"My dog could tell the difference between bottled and tap water.\" He says.    But is plain tap water all that bad? Not at all. In fact, New York's municipal water for more than a century was called the champagne of tap water and until recently considered among the best in the world in terms of both taste and purity. Similarly, a magazine in England found that tap water from the Thames River tasted better than several leading brands of bottled water that were 400 times more expensive. Nevertheless, soft-drink companies view bottled water as the next battle-ground for market share-this despite the fact that over 25 percent of bottled water comes from tap water: PepsiCo's Aquafina and Coca-Cola's Dasani are both purified tap water rather than spring water. As diners thirst for leading brands, bottlers and restaurateurs salivate   over the profits. A restaurant's typical mark-up on wine is 100 to 150 percent, whereas on bottled water it's often 300 to 500 percent. But since water is much cheaper than wine, and many of the fancier brands aren't available in stores, most dines don't notice or care. As a result, some restaurants are turning up the pressure to sell bottled water. According to an article in The Street Journal, some of the more shameless tactics include placing attractive bottles on the table for a visual sell, listing brands on the menu without prices, and pouring bottled water without even asking the dinners if they want it. Regardless of how it's sold, the popularity of bottled water taps into our desire for better health, our wish to appear cultivated, and even a longing for lost purity.

Her brother, Gavyn Boscio, 4, loves to cook. But McKenna changed her mind when she discovered that Hasbro, the toy company that produces the popular oven, only makes the toy in purple and pink--and only features girls on the box and in commercials. So instead of buying an oven, McKenna cooked up another plan. She started a campaign to get Hasbro to make a gender-neutral oven. \"I don't want them to make a boys' Easy-Bake Oven and a girls' Easy-Bake Oven,\" McKenna, from Garfield, New Jersey, told the Associated Press. \"I want them to make an Easy-Bake Oven for kids.\"    The Easy-only Bake Oven was first introduced in 1963. At the time, the stereotype was that only women cooked. Today, that's changed, in part thanks to famous male chefs like, Bobby Flay, who used an Easy-Bake Oven when he was a kid. Over the years, Hasbro says the company has featured boys on the packaging and offered the product in several different color1 schemes. But this year, just the purple and pink model is available. McKenna wants that to change, and she's not alone. Her petition , posted on change.org, has received more than 45,000 signatures.    By next summer, McKenna should have her wish. On December 17, Hasbro invited the New Jersey teen and her family to their headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to meet with the Easy-Bake Oven team. They showed her a prototype, or model, of their newest Easy-Bake Oven, which is scheduled to hit stores in 2013. The new color1 scheme is black, silver and blue. The company also told McKenna they plan to feature boys in ads.    McKenna was happy with what she saw at Hasbro. \"They really met most or even all of what I wanted them to, and they really amazed me,\" McKenna said. She added that Gavyn thought the new design was \"awesome\". How did McKenna probably feel when she found out what kind of oven Hasbro produces? ks5u", "subject": "other", "choices": "['Excited.'

{"question": "Airtight plastic bags can help farmers protect their harvests without the use of harmful chemicals. These bags are designed to keep air out of crops in storage. Using them is a simple way to fight insects and keep crops fresh.     Ten countries in West and Central Africa are involved in a project to improve the storage of cowpeas, also known as black-eyed peas. Farmers can lose much of the harvest to insects called bruchids  , which grow from egg to adult in a few weeks and then lay forty to sixty eggs. They can destroy the whole harvest within months.     Farmers can sell their crops immediately. But selling at harvest time means more competition and lower prices.Or they can use pesticides   to kill the bugs. But a crop scientist Dieudonne Baributsa says, \"They end up misusing or overusing the pesticide. In Nigeria, they have reported a lot of cases of death. They usually call cowpeas 'killer beans' in Nigeria.\"     Mr. Baributsa is a researcher at Purdue University in Indiana, America. The project is called PICS---Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage. He says the storage bags are thick enough that any insects already in the cowpeas willdie from a lack of oxygen. The lack of air will also help prevent the growth of bacteria that can ruin the harvest. The bags cost about two dollars each. Mr. Baributsa says that is not much, especially if it means farmers can wait long enough to get a better price for their crops. The bags are produced locally. Donors currently support the project, but the groups involved are working to build a lasting market for the bags because donation for the project will not lastforever.     A company based in the United States called GrainPro makes another kind of airtight bags. These are called SuperGrainbags. Phil Villers, the company's president, says storing a harvest safely not only helps farmers earn more money, but also reduces the amount of the harvest loss to insects, spoilage and mishandling. \"What does not get wasted and eaten means it is possible to feed a hungry world,\" said Phil Villers.

{"question": "WASHINGTON-School lunches have been called many things, but a group of retired military officers is giving them a new label: national security threat. That's not a reference to the mystery meat served up in the cafeteria line either. The retired officers are saying that school lunches have helped make the nation's young people so fat that fewer of them can meet the military's physical fitness standards, and recruitment will be difficult. A new report being released Tuesday says more than 9 million young adults, or 27 percent of all Americans ages 17 to 24, are too overweight to join the military. Now, the officers are advocating for passage of a wideranging nutrition bill that aims to make the nation's school lunches healthier. The military group acknowledges that other things keep young adults out of the armed services, such as a criminal record or the lack of a high school diploma. But weight problems that have worsened over the past 15 years are now the leading medical reason that recruits are rejected. Although all branches of the military now meet or exceed recruitment goals, retired Navy Rear Adm. James Barnett Jr., a member of the officers group, says the _ trend could affect that. \"When over a quarter of young adults are too fat to fight, we need to take notice,\" Barnett said. He noted that national security in the year 2030 is \"absolutely dependent\" on reversing child obesity rates. This isn't the first time the military has gotten involved in the debate over school lunches. During World War II, military leaders had the opposite problem, reporting that many recruits were rejected because of stunted growth and inadequate nutrition. After the war, military leaders pushed Congress to establish the national school lunch program so children would grow up healthier. Today, the group is urging Congress to eliminate junk food and highcalorie beverages from schools, put more money into the school lunch program and develop new strategies that help children develop healthier habits.

{"question": "Interest in searching for international careers has increased to a high level in recent years, improved by lasting personnel shortages that are causing companies to search beyond their home borders for talent. Professionals seek career experience outside of their home countries for a variety of reasons. They may feel the need to recharge their batteries with a new challenge. They may want a position with more responsibility that encourages creativity and initiative . Or they may wish to expose their children to another culture, and the opportunity to learn a second language. When applying for a job, one usually has to hand in a resume or curriculum vitae (CV). The two terms generally mean the same thing: one or two pages describing one's educational qualifications and professional experience. However, guidelines for preparing a resume are constantly changing. The best advice is to find out what is suitable regarding the corporation culture, the country culture, and the culture of the person making the hiring decision. The challenge will be to include two or more cultures in one page. The following list is a good place to start. * Educational requirements differ from country to country. In almost every case of 'crossborder' job hunting, just stating the title of your degree will not be an adequate description. Provide the reader with details about your studies and any related experience. * Pay attention to the resume way you use: chronological or reversechronological order. Chronological order means listing your 'oldest' work experience first. Reversechronological order means listing your current or most recent experience first. Most countries have preferences about which way is most acceptable. If you find no specific guidelines, the general preference is for the reversechronological way. * If you hand in your resume in English, find out if the recipient   uses British English or American English because there are differences between the two versions. For example, university education is often referred to as 'tertiary education' in the United Kingdom, but this term is almost never used in the United States.

{"question": "Sleeping in on Saturday after a few weeks of too little shuteye may feel refreshing, but it can give a false sense of security. New research shows long-term sleep loss cannot be cured that easily. Scientists researched the effects of short- and long-term sleep loss and found that those who suffer long-term sleep loss may function normally soon after waking up, but experience steadily slower reaction times as the day goes by, even if they had tried to catch up the previous night. The research has important safety significances in an increasingly busy society, not just for shift-workers but for the roughly one in six Americans who regularly get six hours or less of sleep a night. \"We know that staying awake 24 hours without sleep will affect your performance to do all sorts of things, and this effect equals to drinking too much when driving,\" said lead researcher Dr. Daniel Cohen of Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital. But when those who suffer long-term sleep loss become all-nighters, \"the harm is increased ten times,\" Cohen said. The National Institutes of Health says adults need seven hours to nine hours of sleep for good health. Regularly getting too little sleep increases the risk of health problems, including memory impairment and a weakened immune system. More immediately, too little sleep affects reaction times; sleepiness is to blame for car crashes and other accidents. It has critically important complicated and unexpected results for anyone who works \"crazy hours\" and thinks they are performing fine with a few hours of weeknight sleep, said Harris, director at New York's Montefiore Medical Center. \"Don't think you can just _ your sleep on the weekend, because it doesn't work that way,\" he warned.

In fact, if you had asked her then what wanted to be, she would have said, \" I want to play shortstop for the Los Angeles Dodgers.\" Sally collected baseball cards by the boxful, and she knew the name and batting average  of every player in the National League. But major league baseball didn't seem much of a possibility for a girl, even an athletic one like Sally, so her father and mother talked her into taking tennis lessons when she was twelve. At first she hated to trade in her baseball bat for a tennis racket, but it wasn't long before she started to win tournaments in her new sport. \" Tennis became much more fun when I started winning,\" Sally remembers. Soon a row of trophies  replaced her box of baseball cards, and tennis star Billie Jean King replaced Dodger shortstop Maury Wills as her sports idol. Sally first became interested in the space program in 1962 when astronaut John Glenn orbited the earth in his Mercury space capsule. Sally was ten years old at the time, but she remembers the launch and the splashdown   as if they happened yesterday. The girl who used to memorize batting averages became a space fan. She quickly learned the name of every NASA astronaut(there were only eight of them in 1962), the date of every launch, and the name and number of every spacecraft from Freedom 7 to Skylab 3. She could tell you the speed of light (186,300 miles per second), the distance to the moon (238,860 miles), and the names of the three nearest stars( the Sun, Alpha Centauri, and Barnard's Star). By the time she was sixteen, Sally had decided to become an astrophysicist, a scientist who studies space. She had also become a nationally ranked tennis player. She remembers yawning  through an important tennis match on June 20, 1969, after staying up all night to watch Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon. Sally lost the match. As Sally got older, many of her friends started playing professional tennis. Some of them tried to talk her into quitting school to join them on the professional tennis circuit. But Sally said no. \" Black holes are more interesting to me than backhands,\" she told them.

But when it came to descriptions of their presenting problems, things got a little vague. Two of the children had headaches, but the headaches weren't accompanied by the normal body language of holding the head or trying to keep it still. Two children had earaches, but only one could tell me which ear was affected. The mother complained of a cough but seemed to work to produce it.

{"question": "Are _ born or made? In my case it was definitely made. In my early 20s, I hardly went to bed before midnight, and I would always get up late the next morning. But after a while I couldn't ignore the high relationship between success and rising early. On those rare occasions where I did get up early, I noticed that my productivity   was always higher. So I set out to become a habitual early riser. But whenever my alarm went off, my first thought was always to stop that noise and go back to sleep. Eventually some sleep research showed that my strategy was wrong. The most common wrong strategy is this: supposing you're going to get up earlier, you'd better go to bed earlier. It sounds very reasonable, but will usually fail. There are two main schools   of thought on sleep patterns. One is that you should go to bed and get up at the same time every day. The second school says you should go to bed when you're tired and get up when you naturally wake up. However, I have found both are wrong if you care about productivity. If you sleep at fixed hours, you'll sometimes go to bed when you aren't sleepy enough. You're wasting time lying in bed awake. My solution is to combine both methods. I go to bed when I'm sleepy and get up with an alarm clock at a fixed time. So I always get up at the same time (in my case 5 a.m.), but I go to bed at different times every night.

They found that when people listened to their favorite music, their blood vessels    _ in much the same way as when they are laughing, or taking blood medications. \"We have a pretty impressive effect,\" said Dr Michael Miller, director of preventive cardiology   at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore. \"Blood vessel diameter improved,\" he said. \"The vessel opened up pretty significantly. You can see the vessels opening up with other activities such as exercise.\" A similar effect is seen with drugs such as statins. When blood vessels open up more, blood flows more smoothly and is less likely to form the clots   that cause heart attacks and strokes. \"We are not saying to stop your statins or not to exercise but rather to add this to an overall program of heart health,\" said Miller, who presented his findings to a meeting of the American Heart Association in New Orleans. Miller's team tested 10 healthy, non-smoking men and women, who were told to bring their favorite music. They spent half an hour listening to the recordings and half an hour listening to music they said made them feel anxious while the researchers did ultrasound tests designed to show blood vessel function. Compared to their normal baseline measurements, blood vessel diameter increased 26 percent on average when the volunteers heard their joyful music. Listening to music they disliked -- in most cases in this group heavy metal -- blood vessels narrowed by six percent, Miller said. Miller said he came up with the idea after discovering that laughter caused blood to literally flow more smoothly. \"I asked myself what other things make us feel really good, besides calories from dark chocolate of course.

{"question": "Recently more students are choosing to study abroad as they think it is worthwhile. However, some people think it is not a good idea. There are a number of disadvantages in studying abroad. The following paragraphs will explain why students have these views and the advantages of studying abroad will be discussed.   Students studying abroad may suffer from racial discrimination . As they left their home country, they will become part of a minority group in the new country. The majority group may have a sense of superiority and try to bully them. It is common that Americans or the British discriminate against people from other countries since many of them think that white people are better than others.   In addition, the students may lose their own cultures. Since they have moved to a new place, all the thing there - people, lifestyle and the living environment---would be different from those in their own country. As they will have close contact with the local people and culture, they will be influenced by the new culture even without realizing it. It is ironic that a Chinese person speaks better English than Chinese and forgets about Chinese culture after studying abroad for a few years.   On the other hand, studying abroad will widen the view of students. Although they may give up their own culture, they can really learn from others. As students of the modern world , they should not limit their scope to their home country, but get exposed to the world. Studying abroad can help them expand their horizon and learn many things in the host country, as they will meet and make friends with people from all over the world. So, studying abroad is good for them.   Furthermore, students will learn how to be mature and independent. Students, when in their home country, usually rely on their parents. Statistics show that Chinese students usually rely heavily on their parents; they will leave problems alone and ask their parents to solve them. If they are studying abroad, on many occasions they have to learn how to cope with difficulties they meet. As a result, studying abroad benefits them.    Moreover, the education system of the foreign country may be better than the home country's education system. The home country's education system is very limited. Many teachers just spoon-feed their students. They will ask the students to recite a lot of things and then ask them to write them down. This choice of subjects in school, especially in secondary school, is very narrow; the students cannot choose what they want most. But in some schools in Britain and America, students can choose from a wider range of subjects at school. For example, media studies and corporate communications are courses of study in some schools of those two countries. If students choose to study abroad, they may have the opportunity to learn more things under a better education system.    All in all, studying abroad will change and influence a student in many aspects. Although it is uncertain if the effects will be positive or negative, I believe students should seize the opportunity to study abroad because they will meet many new things and have new experiences in the new country. If they are clever enough, I think they can find a balance between learning about the new culture and holding onto their own one.

{"question": "A city child's summer is spent in the street in front of his home,and all through the long summer vacations I sat on the edge of the street and watched enviously the other boys on the block play baseball. I was never asked to take part even when one team had a member missing--not out of special cruelty, but because they took it for granted that I would be no good at it. They were right,of course. I would never forget the wonderful evening when something changed. The baseball ended about eight or eight thirty when it grew dark. Then it was the custom of the boys to retire to a little stoop  that stuck out from the candy store on the corner and that somehow had become theirs. No grownup ever sat there or attempted to. There the boys would sit, mostly talking about the games played during the day and of the game to be played tomorrow. Then long silences would fall and the boys would wander off one by one. It was just after one of those long silences that my life as an outsider changed. I can no longer remember which boy it was that summer evening who broke the silence with a question;but whoever he was,I nod to him gratefully now. \" What's in those books you're always reading?\" he asked casually. \"Stories,\" I answered. \"What kind?\"asked somebody else without much interest. Nor do I know what drove me to behave as I did,for usually I just sat there in silence,glad enough to be allowed to remain among them;but instead of answering his question,I told them for two hours the story I was reading at the moment. The book was Sister Carrie. They listened bugeyed and breathless. I must have told it well,but I think there was another and deeper reason that made them so keen an audience. Listening to a tale being told in the dark is one of the most ancient of man's entertainments,but I was offering them as well,without being aware of doing it,a new and exciting experience. The books they themselves read were the Rover Boys or Tom Swift or G.A. Henry. I had read them too,but at thirteen I had long since left them behind. Since I was much alone I had become an enthusiastic reader and I had gone through the booksforboys series. In those days there was no reading material between children's and grownups' books,or I could find none. I had gone right from Tom Swift and His Flying Machine to Theodore Dreiser and Sister Carrie. Dreiser had hit my young mind,and they listened to me tell the story with some of the wonder that I had had in reading it. The next night and many nights thereafter,a kind of unspoken ritual  took place. As it grew dark,I would take my place in the center of the stoop and begin the evening's tale. Some nights,in order to taste my victory more completely,I cheated. I would stop at the most exciting part of a story by Jack London or Bret Harte,and without warning tell them that was as far as I had gone in the book and it would have to be continued the following evening. It was not true,of course;but I had to make certain of my newlyfound power and position. I enjoyed the long summer evenings until school began in the fall. Other words of mine have been listened to by larger and more fashionable audiences,but for that tough and athletic one that sat close on the stoop outside the candy store,I have an unreasoning love that will last forever.

{"question": "People always think men are more skilled than women in driving. Nowadays women appear to have a positive image of themselves as safer drivers than men. In a survey done for insurer MetLife, 51% of women said they drive more safely. The evidence is on their side: Men are 3.4 times more likely than women to get a ticket for careless driving and 3.1 times as likely to be punished for drunk driving. \"Women are on average less aggressive and more law abiding   drivers, which leads to fewer accidents.\" the report says. However, not all male drivers share the same opinion. Of the men surveyed by MetLife, 39% claimed male drivers were safer. The findings did back them up on one point: automotive knowledge. The report showed that more men are familiar with current safety equipment such as electronic stability control, which helps prevent rollover accidents. Auto safety unavoidably matters to money. Insurance companies focus on what classes of drivers have the lowest dollar amounts of claims, and for now, that mainly includes women. In general, women pay about 9% less for auto insurance than men. A study by the website Insweb also showed that auto insurance rates are lower for women in most states. Among individual states, women get the greatest advantage in Wyoming (where they pay 20% less), South Dakota and Washington, D. C., where their insurance costs are 16% lower. \"More than 11,900 male drivers died in U.S. traffic accidents in 2009, compared with just under 4,900 women drivers,\" according to the study. \"Based on miles traveled, men died at a rate of 2.5 deaths per 100 million miles traveled, v.s. 1.7 deaths for women.\" We can infer from the passage that   _  .", "subject": "other", "choices": "['men are 3.1 times more likely to get tickets than women'\n 'all women in the USA pay the same for their auto insurance'\n 'more female drivers die every year than male drivers'\n 'women are generally safer drivers than the opposite sex']", "answer": "3"}

Researchers raised baby mice from birth to weaning   in either \"summer\" light cycles of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark or \"winter\" cycles of 8 hours of light and 16 hours of dark. A third group experienced 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark a day. Then half the winter mice stayed in a winter cycle, while half switched to a summer schedule. The summer mice were similarly _ . The mice raised in equal periods of light and dark were split into three groups, one of which stayed on the 12hour schedule, one of which joined the winter group, and one of which joined the summer group. After 28 days, it turns out the summerborn mice behaved the same whether they stayed on the summer cycle or switched to winter. But among the winterborn mice, those stayed in winter kept their previous schedule, while those that switched to summer stayed active for an extra hour and a half, which indicates that mice born and weaned in a winter light cycle showed dramatic disruptions in their biological clocks. The finding is the first of its kind in mammals, and it could explain why people born in winter are at higher risk for mental health disorders including bipolar depression, schizophrenia and seasonal affective disorder. \"We know that the biological clock regulates mood in humans,\"said study researcher McMahon. \"If the mechanism   similar to the one that we found in mice operates in humans, then it could not only have an effect on a number of behavioral disorders, but also have a more general effect on personality.\" What's the main idea of the text?", "subject": "other", "choices": "['The biological clock regulates mood in humans.'\n 'People born in winter are at higher risk for physical health disorders.'\n \"Being born in winter has a negative effect on people's mental health.\"\n 'The length of light will influence the behavior of the mice.']", "answer": "2"}

If you're a natural list maker you can consider this habit as a good thing to do.

Helps you stay in the moment: It sounds surprising, but true. Trying to mentally keep track of the things weighing on your mind can make it tougher to concentrate on the activity at hand.  _ : Instead of carrying around a nagging   nervousness that you've forgotten to take care of a chore, keeping an up-to-date list can help relieve that kind of stress. Helps planning: Most of us are likely to put off until tomorrow what we can do today, but keeping a list helps to keep this natural impulse at bay. Thinking about what has to be done in advance is a good way to prevent us from falling behind schedule. Prioritizes  : Seeing everything we want to take care of allows us to prioritize and give the most time to the more important tasks. On the other hand, not having a to-do list makes it possible for us to spend too much time on unimportant items.

{"question": "Standard English is the formal English that you need to use when you write in coursework  or in the exam. Standard English is the form of English you learn in school. All written English should be standard -- that means it should be clear enough for anyone in Britain to understand it. Standard English developed as the main form of printed English in the 15th Century. At the time, every region of Britain used to spell words differently, but printers needed a fixed spelling.  Printers like Caxton chose the East Midlands dialect form which was used in London and the South East. Soon Standard English replaced all written dialect forms -- the other forms of English spoken around the country. It also replaced French and Latin in law and in academic work. In the 18th Century, people wrote dictionaries and grammar books which standardized spelling -- Dr Johnson's Dictionary of 1755 fixed many of the spellings we still use today. All written English should be Standard English -- any grammar rules you learn are for Standard English and you will definitely need to learn them to avoid making mistakes in your work. The rules of Standard English mean using the correct forms of words with the correct spellings.  Avoid slang words -- words that your teachers or friends wouldn't understand. You'll lose marks if the examiners can't understand what you say or write. Don't use dialect words. Every region has words or phrases that are only used there. Don't use them in your coursework, because you won't be understood. Make sure you revise grammar and punctuation you have learned, and learn the list of commonly misspelled words you have made. Cliches are ideas or sayings which have been used so often that they've become boring and unoriginal. Phrases like, \"As good as it gets\" \"At the end of the day\" \"In the fullness of time\" are all cliches. So are images like, \"as fierce as a lion\" \"as cunning as a fox\".

{"question": "Chuck Wall teaches management and human relations at Bakersfield College. He walked into class one day and told his students that their homework was to perform one act of random  kindness. His students did not understand the homework and didn't know what to do, but the professor would not answer their questions. He encouraged his students to work it out for themselves. One week later, the students entered the classroom excited to share their stories. One student told of giving away blankets to the homeless. Another reported on helping a dog to find its owner, and another student had been trying to find a long, lost friend. Students were energized   by the homework assignment and wanted other people to be kind too. With the support of local businesses, the students made stickers to put on cars that invited people to do something kind for others. They sold the stickers and decided to donate the money to a center for the blind---not surprising as Professor Wall is blind. Since then, similar kindness activities have been started in schools around the world. Many schools organize a Random Acts of Kindness Week, around November 13th, to celebrate World Kindness Day.

{"question": "Is it possible that the sinking of the Titanic was caused by a ghost? A lot of the story below is true... but did it really happen quite like this? Our story begins not in the icy cold waters of the North Atlantic, but rather thousands of miles away in Egypt. It is here, perhaps, that we can find the start of the mystery of the Titanic, in the year 1910, in the great city of Cairo. One day, a famous professor of Egyptian history called Douglas Murray was staying in Cairo, when he was contacted by an American adventurer. The American had something unusual to offer Murray, something that was certain to thrill him: a beautiful ancient Egyptian mummy case, containing the mummy of an Egyptian queen. It was over 3000 years old, but in beautiful condition -- gold, with bright paintings on it. Murray was delighted with both the object and the asking price. He gave the man a cheque immediately. The cheque was never cashed. That evening the American adventurer died. For his part, Murray arranged to have the treasure sent back to Britain. However, it was not long before he learnt more about the beautiful mummy case: On the walls of the tomb in which it had been discovered, there were messages which warned of terrible consequences to anyone who broke into the tomb. Murray was disbelieving of these warnings until a few days later, when a gun he was holding exploded in his hand, shattering his arm. The arm had to be cut off. After the accident, Murray decided to return to his homeland. On the return journey, two of his companions died mysteriously, and two servants who had handled the mummy also passed away. The now-terrified Murray decided he would get rid of the _ case as soon as he arrived in London. A lady he knew named Janet Jones said she would like it, so he gave it to her. Shortly afterwards, Jones' mother died, and she herself caught a strange disease. She tried returning the mummy, but naturally Murray refused it. In the end, it was presented to the British Museum. Even in the museum, the mummy apparently continued to cause strange events. A museum photographer died shortly after taking pictures of the new exhibit; and a manager also died for no apparent reason. In the end, the British Museum decided to get rid of the mummy too. They sold it to a collector in New York. At the start of April 1912, arrangements for the transfer were complete, and the mummy began the journey to its new home. But the New Yorker never received the mummy or its case. For when the Titanic sank, one of the objects in its strong room was the mummy case. Or so they say.

{"question": "There are always times in the day when you catch yourself clenching your teeth if you are trying to focus on something important or concentrating on something. Of course, if you are doing this in your sleep you won't be able to catch yourself and stop. The good news is that there are things you can do to help relieve the pain that is caused from bruxism  and help keep your teeth healthy as well. If you wake up in the moming with sore jaws, pain in your neck and shoulders, or a persistent headache, you are more than likely to have bruxism. A lot of medical professionals think that a major aspect of bruxism is from stress. Everyday life can be filled with stressful situations and this stress gets released at night when you are sleeping. If you suffer from stress on a regular basis you can try a relaxation technique before you go to bed. The hope is that by relaxing your body and mind you will let go of the stress that will cause you to grind your teeth while you are sleeping. This routine has worked for millions of people and is a good thing to try first. While relaxation to relieve stress sounds pretty good, there are people that this technique doesn't work for. For these people, there are mouth guards that you can wear while you are sleeping that will help protect your teeth. These mouth guards will put a protective layer between your teeth in order to ease any issues that grinding your teeth may cause. If you want to get the best possible relief you should try both the relaxation techniques and a mouth guard.

{"question": "What we eat, when we eat or how we eat is usually considered to be an everyday eating habit. Good eating habits are very important for our health. Most of us would rather eat sweets and ice-cream than meat and rice. Sweets and ice-cream are not bad for the stomach if we eat them at the end of a meal. But we should also know that if we eat them before a meal, they will spoil   our appetite  . It is a good habit for us to eat our meal at the same time each day. When we feel hungry, it is a sign that our body needs a good supply. When we feel angry or excited, we may not want to eat. A long time ago, in England some judges used to decide whether a man was telling the truth by giving him some dry bread. If he could not swallow   the bread, it was a sign that he wasn't telling the truth. He was telling lies. Although this seems very strange and rather foolish, it is indeed an excellent way of finding out the truth. A man who is worrying about something has difficulty in swallowing anything dry.

{"question": "The time children spend outdoors could be linked to a reduced risk of being short-sighted, research suggests.    An analysis of eight previous studies by University of Cambridge researchers found that for each additional hour spent outside per week, the risk of short-sightedness was reduced by 2%.They said exposure to natural light and time spent looking at distant objects could be key factors .    The studies involved more than 10,000 children and adolescents. Dr Justin Sherwin and his research team concluded that short-sighted children spent an average of 3.7 fewer hours per week outdoors than those who either had normal vision or were far-sighted.    But they said the reasons were not yet clear.They expected to find that children who spent more time outdoors also spent less time doing activities like reading, studying or playing computer games, but no such link was found in two of the eight studies which looked at this relationship.    However, Dr Sherwin said they would now need more precise data to try to understand which factors,  such as increased use of distance vision, reduced use of near vision, natural ultraviolet  light exposure  and physical activity,are most important.    \"Any increase in time spent outdoors must be weighed against exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the increased risk of skin cancer, cataracts and other cancers.\"he said.\"On the other hand, increasing outdoor physical activity could protect against diabetes and obesity, for example.\"     Short-sightedness is a common eye condition that causes distant objects to appear blurred , while close objects can be seen clearly. It is much more common today in the UK and the United States than it was just 30 to 40 years ago. Approximately 1-2% of five-year-olds to seven-year-olds in the UK have short-sightedness.About.five million British people are short-sighted and some 200,000 of them will be seriously short-sighted.

{"question": "In the Netherlands,cycling isn't seen as an eco-friendly exercise; it's part of everyday life, as it's people's top choice to school and work. \"There are more bicycles than residents in the Netherlands. In cities like Amsterdam and The Hague, up to 70 percent of all journeys are made by bike,\" said BBC.  So how did cycling become such a popular means of transportation in the European country? In the 1970s, the Dutch government began to improve its cycling infrastructure due to both a social movement demanding safer cycling condition for children and the oil crisis in the Middle East, when oil producing countries stopped their exports to Western Europe. To make cycling safer and more appealing, the Dutch have built the widest cycling network in the world. The country has over 40,000 kilometers of bicycle lanes and paths,which are clearly marked. They have smooth surfaces,separate signs and lights for those on two wheels. The lanes are wide enough to allow side-by-side cycling and passing. In many cities the bike lanes are completely segregated from motorized traffic. And in many traffic situations cyclists are given priority over drivers. Sometimes,where space is limited and both must share, you can see signs showing an image of a cyclist with a car behind accompanied by the words \"Bike Street:Cars are guests\". As young people aren't allowed to drive alone until they are 18, cycling offers Dutch teenagers an alternative form of freedom. The government also makes cycling training lessons a compulsory part of the Dutch school curriculum . Bike parking facilities are everywhere in the country. Cyclists are accommodated in the way motorists are elsewhere. Take Groningen, a city in the northeastern part of the Netherlands, for example. The city's central train station has underground parking for 10,000 bikes. For many Dutch people, bikes are trusty friends for life's adventures. In that kind of relationship it is longevity  that matters--that's why many Dutch people ride older bikes.

{"question": "Speaking in any language is all about imitating   other people. You want to be able to speak like native speakers do. Before you can form your own correct sentences, you first need to see lots of similar ones in the language you are learning. When you speak in your native language, you don't have to think about the grammar or the words you use. Correct sentences just come to you. In fact, your brain uses sentences you've already seen or heard. If you want to speak a foreign language fluently, you have to learn it the way you learned your native language--- by massive  input. Reading and listening will help you develop language intuition . It's all about putting lots of correct sentences in your head. Then your brain can imitate them, producing similar sentences to express the meaning you want. When you read and listen a lot, paying attention to useful vocabulary, you will soon start to use new words and phrases in your speaking and writing, and you will develop language intuition. You will start to feel what sounds good and what sounds bad --- just as you do in your native language. It may seem like you need more time to learn a language by reading and listening, as opposed  to learning based on grammar rules. For example, to get a good feeling for the use of articles in English you need to read lots of sentences, analyzing them closely. Wouldn't it be easier to read a unit on articles in a grammar book? Well, the problem is that it takes lots of time to build a sentence when you have to think of grammar rules. When you talk to someone, you don't have time for that.

{"question": "What will power your house in the future? According to scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, it might be artificial leaves.    Natural leaves can change sunlight and water into energy. It is known as photosynthesis . Now researchers have found a way to imitate this process.    The artificial leaf developed by Daniel Nocera and his colleagues at MIT can be seen as a special silicon chip with catalysts . Similar to natural leaves, it can split water into hydrogen and oxygen when put into a bucket of water. The hydrogen and oxygen gases are then stored in a fuel cell, using those two materials to produce electricity, located either on top of a house or beside the house.    Though the leaf is shaped like a poker card, scientists stated that it is promising to be an inexpensive somtoe of electricity in developing countries. \"One can imagine villages in India and Africa not long from now purchasing an affordable basic power system based on this technology,\" said an American scientist, Docera.   An artificial leaf is not a new idea. The first artificial leaf was invented in 1997 but too expensive and unstable for practical use. The new leaf, however, is made of cheap materials, easy to use and highly stable. In laboratory studies, Nocera showed that an artificial leaf could operate continuously for at least 45 hours.    The wonderful improvements come from Nocera's recent discovery of several powerful new, inexpensive catalysts. These catalysts make the energy transformation inside the leaf more efficient with water and sunlight. Right now, the new leaf is about 10 times more effective at carrying out photosynthesis than a natural one. Besides, the device can run in whatever water is available.      Hopefully, each home could possible have the access to the new application in the future.

Hamilton's parents were both surfers and they started teaching Bethany how to surf at a young age, and she learned quickly with the support of her brothers. By age 8, Bethany was winning first place in surfing contests for her age group. Hamilton began competing more seriously at the age of nine, winning several more competitions in her age group. On October 31, 2003, while surfing with friends near Tunnels Beach, a 14-foot tiger shark attacked her. Bethany said, \"My arm was hanging in the water, and it just came and bit me. It kind of pulled me back and forth. But I just held onto my board and then the shark let go.\" The shark tore off Bethany's left arm just below her shoulder.  Hamilton's friends rushed her to the hospital. Bethany made it through several surgeries without infection  , and miraculously survived even though she had lost almost 60% of her blood.  The doctor said that her athletic training helped her to survive the attack and blood loss. While she was healing, Bethany thought for a while that she might not surf again. She was concerned that it would be much harder to stand up on the board using only one hand and that her balance would be completely off. But with hard work and determination she returned to surfing. She says, \"It's hard for me to describe the joy I felt after I stood up and rode a wave in for the first time after the attack.  I was greatly thankful and happy inside.

{"question": "LONDON ( Reuters)-- Ecotourism   is causing a lot of damage to wildlife and may be endangering the survival  of the very animals people are flocking to see, according to researchers. Biologists and conservationists   are worried because polar bears, dolphins, penguins and other creatures are getting stressed and losing weight and some are dying. \"Evidence is growing that many animals do not react well to tourists in their backyard,\" New Scientist magazine said. The immediate effects researchers have noticed are changes in behavior, heart rates, or stress hormone levels but they fear it could get much worse and over the long term \"could endanger the survival of the very wildlife they want to see\". Although money produced through ecotourism, which has been growing at about 10--30 percent a year, has major benefits for poor countries and people living in rural areas, the Swiss-based World Conservation Union (IUCN) and some governments fear not all projects are audited   and based on environmentally friendly policies, according to the magazine. \"The transmission  of disease to wildlife, or small changes to wildlife health through disturbance of daily life or increased stress levels, while not obvious to the casual observer, may translate to lower survival and breeding,\" said Philip Seddon, of the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. Scientists have noticed that bottleneck dolphins along the northeastern coast of New Zealand become nervously excited when tourist boats arrive. Similar changes in behavior have been observed in polar bears and yellow-eyed penguins in areas visited by ecotourists are producing smaller babies. Conservationists are now calling for more research into the effect of ecotourism on animals and say the industry must be developed carefully.

{"question": "On the night of July 6, 1943, a plane took off from an Air Force base in England to stop German fighters over the English Channel. Piloting the plane was Captain Thomas Nash. Looking westward, Nash saw twelve orange lights in a row, moving at a very high rate of speed. Thinking they might be a new German weapon, he swung the plane around and headed directly for the lights, but they disappeared. Captain Nash may have been the first to see such orange lights but he wasn't the last. His experience was repeated many times by pilots during World War II both in England and Far East. What were they? No one knows for sure, but there is an interesting theory to explain them. According to this theory, the orange lights are space animals---animals specially adapted   to life in the upper atmosphere just as some living things are adapted to life at the bottom of the sea. These space animals, the theory says, live so far up in the atmosphere that they are not in sight from the earth. They feed partly on the air and partly on energy from the sunlight. Being almost pure energy themselves, their body shine at night. During the day, however, they are invisible. Before World War II, continues the theory, there was little radiated energy on the earth's surface. Then came the development of rockets, nuclear power stations and something like that. The space animals are attracted to these kinds of energy of food. At night when there is no energy from the sunlight, they come down into the lower levels in search of a meal. They may even float into the range of human eyesight. This explains the fact that they have been sighted many times from the earth since 1943.

The report showed that more men are familiar with current safety equipment such as electronic stability control,which helps prevent rollover accidents. Auto safety unavoidably matters to Money. Insurance companies focus on what classes of drivers have the lowest dollar amounts of claims, and for now, that mainly includes women. In general, women pay about 9% less for auto insurance than men. A study by the website Insweb also showed that auto insurance rates are lower for women in most states. Among individual states, women get the greatest, advantage in Wyoming (where they pay 20% less), South Dakota and Washington, D.C, where their insurance costs are 16% lower. \"More than 11,900 male drivers died in US traffic accidents in 2009,compared with just under 4,900 women drivers\" according to the study. \"Based on miles traveled, men died at a rate of 2.5 deaths per 100 million miles traveled, vs.1.7 deaths for women.\" Insurance companies focus on female driver clients probably because they  _  .", "subject": "other", "choices": "['cause more accidents on the road'\n 'pay more money to the insurance companies'\n 'take the most part of the insurance clients'\n 'have the lowest amount of money on insurance claims']", "answer": "3"}
{"question": "He was 11 years old and went fishing every chance he got from the dock at his family's cabin on an island in the middle of a New Hampshire lake. On the day before the bass season opened, he and his father were fishing early in the evening, catching sunfish and perch with worms. Then he tied on a small silver lure and practiced casting. The lure struck the water and caused colored ripples in the sunset, then silver ripples as the moon rose over the lake. When his pole doubled over, he knew something huge was on the other end. Finally, he very gingerly lifted the exhausted fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a perch . The boy and his father looked at the handsome fish. Then the father lit a match  and looked at his watch. It was 10 P.M.--- two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy. \"You'll have to put it back, son,\" he said. \"Dad!\" cried the boy. \"There will be other fish,\" said his father. \"Not as big as this one,\" cried the boy. He looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were anywhere around in the moonlight. He looked again at his father. Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he caught the fish, the boy could know everything by his father's clear voice that the decision could not be changed. He slowly worked the hook  out of the lip of the huge bass and lowered it into the black water. The creature swished its powerful body and disappeared. The boy suspected that he would never again see such a great fish. That was 34 years ago. Today, the boy is a successful architect in New York City. His father's cabin is still there on the island in the middle of the lake. He takes his own son and daughters fishing from the same dock. He was right. He has never again caught such a magnificent fish as the one he landed that night long ago. But he does see that same fish---again and again---every time he comes up against a question of ethics .

{"question": "During my visit to my parents, I decided to explore their attic . They have lived in their home in the mountains since 1953, so investigating the attic was a trip down memory lane for me. I climbed the unstable ladder to the dusty, cold third floor. I looked around and noticed a very old basket in the corner, in which I found letters piled high, faded and dirty-untouched there. As I opened each letter, I discovered a new and previously unrevealed page of my parents' lives. My father served in the Army. He wrote about his daily experiences with civilians, German POWs, baths and more. I was drawn to these letters. Each of my mother's letters was sealed with her 1944 lipstick kiss. Daddy wrote that he sealed his return letters by rekissing her lipstick kiss. Oh, how they missed each other!  I finished reading six months of the letters and discovered there were at least eleven months missing. Where could they be?      Just six weeks after my visit, Daddy became very ill and was hospitalized. He was scheduled for kidney dialysis when I decided to fly to visit him. We discussed the letters. He told me how much receiving those lipstick-kissed letters had meant to him when he had been so far from home. As I left, the thought raced through my mind that tomorrow was Valentine's Day. But I quickly dismissed this thought. My father wasn't in any kind of shape to shop for a valentine. My parents had been married for fifty-six years. My mother would understand that her valentine would just have to be skipped this year. Later that evening, Mother and I revisited the attic in search of the lost letters. Toward the bottom, we discovered an unmarked gold cardboard box. Yes! Here were the long-lost letters! I began looking through them. Lying separate, on top of the letters was the valentine card my father had sent Mother in 1944! The next day,Mother and I visited Daddy in the hospital. I joked with him, saying softly, \"Today is Valentine's Day, and I know you have been a little busy lately, but I've got something you covered.\"I handed him the card. He carefully opened the card, and when he recognized it, his eyes filled with tears. There was nothing lacking that Valentine's Day after all. My father, in a voice shaking with emotion, read the loving message he'd sent to my mother fifty-six years earlier. And this time, he could read it to her in person.

{"question": "A super drug that could remove Alzheimer's  ,heart disease and diabetes   and help people live to 100 is being developed by scientists. Their research is based on the identification of three genes that help prolong lives and prevent diseases which occur in old age. Medically controlling the proteins made by the \" longevity genes\" will allow millions to live longer, predicts Dr Nir Barzilai. Those whose DNA strongly features the three genes are 80 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's. The genes also fight against the deadly impact of smoking, poor diet, obesity and lack of exercise. Already, several laboratories are working on a pill to imitate the benefits of the genes and Dr Barzilai thinks it could be tested within three years. The pill could remove some diseases that damage old age. \" The advantage of finding a gene that involves longevity is that we can develop a drug that will imitate exactly what this gene is doing,\" he said. Of the three longevity genes, two genes increase the production of so-called good cholesterol , which reduces the risk of heart disease. The third prevents diabetes. They were discovered by Dr Barzilai's team while studying the DNA of 500 Ashkenazi Jews with an average age of 100. The chances of living that long are one in 10,000 but the group, which shared relatively few common ancestors, was 20 times more likely to hit the entury. Dr Barzilai said: \" 30 percent of them were obese or overweight and 30 percent smoked two acks of cigarettes a day for more than 40 years, however they can live to 100.\" But Andrew Ketteringham of the Alzheimer's Society said: \"Alzheimer's disease, a most common disease, is likely to be caused by a combination of genetic disosition , lifestyles and life events.

{"question": "The snow has paralysed  transport in China during the country's most important vacation period, the celebration of the Chinese New Year. Not only have transport delays hindered personal trips, but they have also slowed the delivery of fresh produce to markets. Consequently, in Zhengzhou, the capital city of the Henan province, tomato prices have doubled, and the cost of 47 other vegetables has increased by 36%, as reported by local media at the end of January. According to an inside PR source, \"wholesalers in Beijing were quoted as saying that only about 20% of the usual fresh vegetable supplies were reaching the city.\" As an Asian country with a diet based on fresh produce, the shortage of vegetables and the rise in prices is not only affecting fresh food producers, but also the final consumers. In terms of production, this is the worst snow disaster to hit China in the last 50 years, affecting a total of 9.4 million hectares of farmland in the country, according to a report published on 4 February 2008 by Feng Tao of Xinhua News, at the Chinese government website. Most of the crops devastated by the frost are located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the traditional natural border between North and South China.

A study of 192 third and fourth grades, generally aged eight and nine, found that children who cut the number of hours spent watching television gained nearly two pounds (0.91 kg) less over a one-year period than those who did not change their television diet. \"The findings are important because they show that weight loss can only be the result of a reduction in television viewing and not any other activity,\" said Thomas Robinson, a pediatrician  at Stanford University. \" American children spend an average of more than four hours per day watching television and videos or playing games, and rates of childhood being very fat have doubled over the past 20 years,\" Robinson said. In the study, presented this week to the Pediatric Academic Societies' annual meeting in San Francisco, the researchers persuaded about 100 of the students to reduce their television viewing by one-quarter to one-third. Children watching fewer hours of television showed a significantly smaller increase in waist size and had less body fat than other students who continue their normal television viewing, even though neither group ate a special diet nor took part in any extra exercise. \"One explanation for the weight loss could be the children unstuck to the television may simply have been moving around and burning off calories,\" Robinson said. \"Another reason might be due to eating fewer meals in front of the television. Some studies have suggested that eating in front of the TV encourages people to eat more,\" Robinson added.

{"question": "Conventional wisdom says that hardship can make us old before our time. In fact, a new study suggests that violence not only leaves long-term scars on children's bodies, but also changes their DNA, causing changes that are equal to seven to ten years of premature aging  . Scientists measured this by studying the ends of children's chromosomes  , called telomeres, says Idan Shalev, lead author of a study published in Molecular Psychiatry. Telomeres are special DNA sequences   which prevent the DNA in chromosomes from separating. They get shorter each time a cell divides, until a cell cannot divide any more and dies. Several factors have been found to shorten telomeres, including smoking, radiation and psychological stresses such as being treated badly when young and taking care of a chronically ill person. In this study, researchers examined whether exposure to violence could make children's telomeres shorten faster than normal. They interviewed the mothers of 236 children at ages 5, 7 and 10, asking whether the youngsters had been exposed to domestic violence between the mother and her partner, physical maltreatment by an adult or bullying. Researchers measured the children's telomeres--in cells obtained from the insides of their cheeks--at ages 5 and 10. Telomeres shortened faster in kids exposed to two or more types of violence, says Shalev. Unless that pattern changes, the study suggests, these kids could be expected to develop diseases of aging, such as heart attacks or memory loss, seven to 10 years earlier than their peers. Shalev says there is hope for these kids. His study found that, in rare cases, telomeres can lengthen. Better nutrition, exercise and stress reduction are three things that may be able to lengthen telomeres, he says. The study confirms a smallbutgrowing number of studies suggesting that early childhood hardship imprints itself in our chromosomes, says Charles Nelson, a professor of pediatrics and neuroscience at Harvard Medical School.

{"question": "A Good Night's Steep Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout your life. While you're sleeping, your brain is forming new pathways to help you learn and remember information. Although we all know the importance of getting a good night's sleep, not all of us know the best way of getting it. A sleep expert, Phil Atherton, gave some top tips for getting the most out of the night, which will leave you ready for action in the morning. According to Phil Atherton, not eating a large meal before bedtime is important for getting a good night's sleep. The time difference between eating and sleeping should be at least three hours. So you'd better avoid eating any food three hours before bed, as it will lower your blood sugar during sleep and help minimize damage from too much sugar floating around. It's also important to find ways to prepare your body for sleep. You can follow a routine like trying not to expose yourself to too much artificial light within 1 hour before bed, as your brain uses light to help set internal \"body clock\". Although it might seem unnatural to schedule your sleep, the purpose is to send a signal to your body and mind that it's time to sleep. Another way to prepare your body for sleep is to get into a relaxed state by taking a bath or listening to soft music. Both of them will help to take the mind off the daytime pressures. Having a suitable bed, especially a suitable mattress  , is necessary for a good night's sleep. Sleep is a personalized activity, and we all adopt different sleeping positions. Finding the mattress that suits you will reduce back pains that can result from a poor sleeping position. The bed should be four to six inches longer than its tallest user, allowing for space to move around. The recent research is pretty clear that a good night's sleep in a major component of good health. Since the start of the 21st century, studies have linked a lack of sleep to many diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. Taking action now will lead to long-term benefits for you and those around you.

He keeps his mind on what he is going to do. He does not begin writing the story until he knows what he should find out. He must know why he should write the story. At times a reporter must search hard to find all of the facts he needs for a story. The facts may not be right under his nose. To find the facts, he has to recognize important details. While gathering information for a story, he asks himself questions:Should I use this information? Is this an important fact? A reporter writes the story as fast as he can, so it can go right away into the newspaper. The story also needs a headline, which tells very quickly what the news story is about and is printed bigger and blacker than the rest of the news story.

{"question": "There is a unique place where deserted factories have been transformed into a lively artistic zone - where the city's tradition and heritage  meet with cutting-edge art and fashion. This is Redtory. Located at Yuancun Si Heng Lu, not far from the Pearl River of Guangzhou city, Redtory is a creative cultural and industrial zone made up of more than 30 old buildings - mostly red-brick ones. Back in 1956, it used to be the biggest canning factory in China. The factory produced the Can Dace   with Black Bean Sauce, an iconic food product in the last century, well-known throughout south-east Asia. After the local government's industrial structure reformations, the canning factory moved away and the workshops were left deserted. There was nothing left but memories in well-preserved Soviet-style buildings. Not long after the noise of the running machines was gone, posters of advertisement and art were found hanging on the wall in the area. To enrich the cultural and artistic life of the people in Guangzhou, the abandoned factories reopened in 2009 - displaying art, fashion and culture of different forms. Redtory is home to more than 40 establishments including art galleries, themed restaurants and design studios. Large international cultural exchange activities, art exhibitions and seminars are often held here, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. Meanwhile, waste materials have been used wisely instead of being thrown away. For instance, some installations  standing around the area are made up of the rusty machines or components from the old canning factory. The shabby and nostalgic  appearance combined with fashionable and artistic features makes Redtory uniquely attractive. That may be the reason that Redtory is considered the holy land for young art-lovers in Guangzhou.

Like others, I have described it to people as \"broken\" English. But I feel embarrassed to say that. It has always bothered me that I can think of no way to describe it other than\"broken\", as if it were damaged and needed to be fixed, as if it lacked a certain wholeness. I've heard other terms used, \"limited English,\" for example. But they seem just as bad, as if everything is limited, including people's perceptions of the limited English speaker. I know this for a fact, because when I was growing up, my mother's \"limited\" English limited my perception of her. I was ashamed of her English. I believed that her English reflected the quality of what she had to say. That is, because she expressed them imperfectly her thoughts were imperfect. And I had plenty of evidence to support me: the fact that people in department stores, at banks, and at restaurants did not take her seriously, did not give her good service, pretended not to understand her, or even acted as if they did not hear her. I started writing fiction in 1985. And for reasons I won't get into today, I began to write stories using all the Englishes I grew up with: the English she used with me, which for lack of a better term might be described as \"broken\" ; and what I imagine to be her translation of her Chinese, her internal   language, and for that I sought to preserve the essence, but neither an English nor a Chinese structure.

{"question": "The timing of school holidays has always had a lot to do with when a family goes on vacation. For many kids, summer holidays mean spending time outdoors and heading toward water- the local swimming pool, a lake, or the beach. What people wear to go swimming or sunbathing has changed a great deal since the early 1990s. Do you know what early swimsuits  looked like and what they were made of? The earliest swimsuits covered most of the body and were called \"bathing clothes\". They were often made of wool, which made them scratchy  and very heavy when they got wet. Newer materials made it possible to make lighter swimsuits. Over time, swimsuits covered less and less of the body. In 1946, the bikini became popular among women. Summer holidays don't just mean going to the water. They can also mean going for a bike ride, or a picnic. It all depends how you want to spend your summer days. If you live or spend your holiday near the water, then fishing, diving and boating are all good possibilities. In summertime, lots of people enjoy playing, picnicking, and just going out with friends on a long summer day until the sun goes down.

{"question": "Two things I really believe in --- saving money and saving the planet, and it's even better when I can do something that accomplishes both at the same time. Rainwater harvesting is just such a thing. In the near future, rainwater harvesting will be as common as twelve-year-old girls carrying cell phones. Many countries already rely heavily on rainwater. Every building in these countries collects the rainwater from its roof and stores it for later use. However, America is just slightly slow to take action. There are many ways to harvest rainwater and most of them are easy and inexpensive. For example, use rain barrels to collect the water that would run off your roof. You'd be surprised at how fast a fifty-gallon barrel will be filled with free, usable water. New building construction offers some good ways to gather rainwater, and the cost of set-up is usually made up by reduced usage very quickly. Rainwater can be conveyed by roof pipes into underground containers, where a pump can draw water up as needed. The rainwater can even be treated to make it drinkable. If that rainwater were not collected, but allowed to run over your lawn , into the street and eventually to a storm water treatment facility, it would pick up all sorts of pollutants on its journey --- chemical compositions and agricultural poisons from the grass, motor oil, waste water and such from the roads, and who knows what else. That is to say, the shorter distance it covers the more drinkable it will be. Depending on where you live, the rainwater may be piped to a treatment plant or it may run in natural channels to allow nature to remove the pollutants. Either way, the treatment of rainwater is high priced. If you reduce the amount of rainwater run-off from your home or office, you reduce the need for treatment. Water is rapidly becoming one of our most precious resources and it is not as abundant as you may think. In the year 2015, the United States used generally 479 billion gallons of fresh water per day.

{"question": "\"Can't hold a candle to\" is a popular expression. It is from the time before electricity, when people used candles for light. Someone who lived in a big house would have a servant light his way by holding a candle. The expression meant that the person who cannot hold a candle to you is not fit even to be your servant. \"Hold out\" is an expression one hears often in sports reports and labor news. It means refusing to play or work. Professional football and baseball players hold out if their team refuses to pay them what they think they are worth. Members of labor unions hold out and refuse to work until they get the work agreement they want. The expression \"hold up\" has several different meanings. One is a robbery. A man with a gun may say, \"This is a hold up. Give me your money.\" Another meaning is to delay. A driver late for work may tell his boss, \"I was held up by heavy traffic.\" Someone who was robbed on the way to work might say, \"Sorry, boss, I was held up by a hold up.\" Still another meaning of the expression is for a story to be considered true after an investigation. The same driver late for work could say, \"My boss did not believe a hold up held me up. But the police confirmed what I said so my story held up.\" \"Hold on\" is another expression. Often it means wait or stop. As you leave for school, your brother may say, \"Hold on, you forgot your book.\" Hold on is also used to ask a telephone caller to wait and not hang up his telephone.

Actually, yes. Paul Bach-y-Rita, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, believes that the senses can changeable. For example, a tongue can be used for seeing. The brain, as we know, is a complex organ . Even when part of it is hurt, it will try to carry out the same function by sending the function to another area of the brain. A college student was asked to take part in an experiment. In the experiment, his eyes were covered with a small video camera. The camera was connected to a long plastic line which went into his mouth. A computer would change the video's picture. The picture would travel through the plastic line as an electric current , reaching the electrodes  inside the student's mouth. The scientist would roll a ball towards his right side, left side, or centre, and the student would have to catch it. When the scientist rolled the ball, pain passed over the student's tongue. For the position of the pain on the tongue, the student reached out his hand and caught the ball. If the brain can see a ball through a camera and a wet tongue, blindness and deafness can be overcame.

{"question": "Growing up in town, I classified myself as a \"city girl.\" I had very little knowledge about farming and rural areas, but all of that changed six years ago when my mother and stepfather married and we moved to my stepfather's farm. Surrounded by cows and cornfields, I was unsure of what to do. However, I did enjoy the beauty and peace of the countryside. On the farm, I helped with odd jobs like feeding cows. When I was old enough to get a real summer job, my step-father said I could choose between two options--getting a job at our local Dairy Queen or selling produce that I grew on our farm. While I came up with a short list of pros   for working at the fast food restaurant, I found more advantages to selling produce. Yet I realized the numerous disadvantages to selling produce: responsibility for the success or failure of the operation, early mornings, and long days. At last, I decided to start my own farming business. My stepfather and I began planning in March. Together we chose three varieties of seeds, prepared the land, and planted the first batch   of sweet corn at the end of April. Throughout the spring, my stepfather continued to plant sweet corn every two weeks as I rode in the tractor with him. The sweet corn needs taking great care while growing. As the corn was putting forth ears, we applied fertilizer and sprayed pesticide to prevent worms. I watched them grow taller and taller, dreaming about the money I would soon make. We planned to harvest and sell the corn at our local farmer's market. It sounded easy and looked good on paper, but it worked out a little differently. Nonstop rain delayed the harvest by a week or so. When my sweet corn was finally ready to pick, I found that a pack of raccoons   had visited the field at night, ruining about half of it. We picked what was still good and prepared for market. This was it--my first day at market! I was excited to see my hard work finally pay off. I loaded my materials into the pickup truck and arrived early at the farmer's market to find a good spot. There were many customers and several other tradesmen. Probably because I was young and new, potential customers would look at me and smile, then head straight to my competitor, Mrs Cates, who had been in the market for years and had an established following. At the end of the first day, about half of my corn was left, so I donated it to a local homeless shelter and went home disappointed. Soon I noticed that Mrs Cates and her crew did not arrive at the farmer's market until about 11 am. So I decided to show up an hour earlier. This meant that we had to start picking corn at 6 am, no easy task with teenage workers. But the effort paid off; I was selling half of my corn before Mrs Cates arrived and most of it by the end of the day. Although the farmer's market was only open three days a week, the corn needed to be picked and sold daily because it would not keep. On days the farmer's market was not open, I developed a marketing plan that included sending e-mails to family and friends. I also went to local businesses to sell corn and distribute business cards. Customers began calling, and I took orders over the phone. Before I knew it, I had a loyal following. I stayed busy by making weekly and sometimes daily deliveries to these businesses while maintaining my produce stand at the farmer's market. Then something wonderful happened. I had made more money than any of my friends with typical teenage jobs. I feel a sense of accomplishment when I see people buy produce from me.

{"question": "When a group of children politely stop a conversation with you, saying: \"We have to go to work now,\" you're left feeling surprised and certainly uneasy. After all, this is the 1990s and the idea of children working is just unthinkable. That is, until you are told that they are all pupils of stage schools, and that the \"work\" they go off to is to go on the stage in a theatre. Stage schools often act as agencies to supply children for stage and television work. More worthy of the name \"stage school\" are those few places where children attend full time, with a training for the theatre and a general education. A visit to such schools will leave you in no doubt that the children enjoy themselves. After all, what lively children wouldn't settle for spending only half the day doing ordinary school work, and acting, singing or dancing their way through the other half of the day? Then of course there are times for the children to make a name and make a little money in some big shows. Some stage schools give their children too much professional work at such a young age. But the law is very tight on the amount they can do. Those under 13 are limited to 40 days in the year; those over 13 to 80 days. The schools themselves admit that not all children will be successful in the profession for which they are being trained. So what happens to those who don't make it?

{"question": "World's Best Places to Visit We hope the following places can help you choose where to go on your next vacation. Zurich   From swimming in Lake Zurich in summer to skiing the Alps in winter, Zurich attracts visitors year-round. As a fairytale city, Zurich is set on the banks of both a river and a lake, with the snow-topped Swiss Alps rising in the background. Clean cobblestone streets hug a hilly land and medieval   church tops reach heavenward. Despite its reputation for being the center of old-school international banking and a capital for chocolate, Zurich is also a very modern city that chooses to enjoy life at an unhurried pace. Travelers desiring a real experience should strive to do the same. The City of Angels  The City of Angels, the Entertainment Capital of the World--Los Angeles needs no introduction. But its notoriety   both helps and hurts its reputation. The traffic on the \"101\" will tire you out just as much as an evening at a lively West Hollywood club. And your dislike at the thick smog over the city will ruin your enjoyment of a sunset overlooking Santa Monica Beach. To appreciate Los Angeles, visit the area more than once and get advice from locals. Prague   A prosperous and busy city, Prague now attracts more tourists than ever. But its picturesque downtown veils   both a dark legacy and a resilient   past; in its 1,100 years, Prague has survived numerous overthrows, invasions, fires and floods. It's this reputation for survival and perseverance that has made the Czech capital so fascinating. Today, its storied churches, narrow streets, hilltop castle and statue-lined bridges create the scene of an urban fairy tale. Even the most tired traveler would have trouble resisting this city's charms. Puerto Rico   Pick a vacation experience you're looking for, and Puerto Rico can help. Puerto Rico is an old town with a lot of historic architecture and cobblestone streets. Look no further than Old San Juan and its El Morro fortress.Consider the bioluminescent   bays of Culebra and Vieques. Puerto Rico is a global destination with high-end shopping and exciting nightlife. Yellowstone   More than 3,000 square miles of nature's finest canyons, hot springs and rocky cliffs are an easy sell for outdoors enthusiasts. Geothermic   wonders like the Mammoth Hot Springs, Old Faithful and Yellowstone Lake are not to be missed at this national park. With dramatic peaks and lakes, Yellowstone is an outdoor enthusiast's paradise. Multicolor1ed pools go around hot springs; green forests weave past wide meadows; and hot springs launch streams of steaming water toward the sky. With so much unspoiled natural beauty, there's no doubt that the park is indeed extraordinary.

{"question": "I was waiting in a check-in line at Arlanda International Airport. The man ahead of me was quite a big guy. As an airport baggage handler checked through a customer at the roadside, he accidentally knocked over the man's luggage. He quickly collected the fallen bags and apologized for his mistake. However,the traveler burst into anger, shouting at the baggage handler for his carelessness. The baggage handler calmly apologized and smiled all the time. The customer continued to berate  the man, even as he turned away and headed for his gate. Through it all the baggage handler smiled and remained calm. The other customers in line witnessed the incident and admired the baggage handler's professionalism and self-control. \"I have never seen such restraint and humility,\" one of the customers sighed, \"How do you keep your cool when somebody is attacking you so viciously?\" \"It's easy,\" the baggage handler answered. \"He's going to London, but his bags are going to Tokyo.\" I won't recommend that we use revenge to relieve stress.

{"question": "Archery   is one of the oldest sports that are still beingpracticed today. The bow and arrow dates as far back as the Old StoneAge, and is the most widely used weapon in human history. While there is recorded evidence of archery competitions taking place in China more than 3,000 years ago, the modern sport of archery most likely originated in England during the 14th century. Then the sport began to develop fast and there were a few different styles of shooting, some of which developed into what we see today in the sport of archery. There was clout shooting, in which arrows were held high into the air with the purpose of hitting a target which was laid flat, not vertical. The aim was to land the arrow as close to the target as possible. This variety of shooting is still practiced today, often with traditional bows. \"Roving marks\", another style, saw players shooting at a target, only to shoot at a new target from the location of the previous target. It is said that this is the oldest form of competitive archery, and was practiced by Henry VIII. Finally, there was butt   shooting, in which butts held targets, which the players would shoot at. This is the ancestor of modern-day Olympic target shooting. Archery was a part of the second Olympic Games, which was held in 1900. It was dropped after 1920, however, because rules varied too much between nations. Archery was brought back into the Olympics in 1972. This was after enough nations had formed archery governing bodies affiliated with the Federation Internationale de Tir l'Arc, which was founded in Paris in 1931, to standardize rules for international competitions. From its early history to modern times, archery has always been a competitive sport.

{"question": "The sounds you make while chewing have a significant effect on the amount of food you eat, a new study has found. The results suggest that people are likely to consume less if they can hear themselves eating. Researchers at Brigham Young University and Colorado State University have found that your TV, radio, and computer are making you fat. Not by bombarding  you with food ads (though they totally are) but by blocking the sounds of your chewing. In a recent study, they found that the noise your food makes while you're eating can have a significant effect on how much food you eat. \"Sound is typically labeled as the forgotten food sense,\" adds Ryan Elder, assistant professor of marketing at BYU's Marriott School of Management. \"But if people are more focused on the sound the food makes, it could reduce consumption.\" \"For the most part, consumers and researchers have overlooked food sound as an important sensory cue  in the eating experience.\" said study coauthor Gina Mohr, an assistant professor of marketing at CSU. The team carried out three separate experiments to quantify the effects of \"food sound salience\" on quantity of food consumed during a meal. In one experiment, participants were given snacks to eat while they wore headphones playing either loud or quiet noises. The ones loud enough to mask the sound of chewing made subjects eat more -- 4 pretzels  compared to 2.75 pretzels for the \"quiet\" group. In another of their experiments they found that just having people hear chewing sounds through an advertisement can decrease the amount they eat. Elder and Morh call this the \"Crunch Effect.\" The main takeaway of their work should be the idea of mindfulness, they said. Being more mindful of not just the taste and physical appearance of food, but also of the sound it makes can help consumers to eat less. \"When you mask the sound of consumption, like when you watch TV while eating, you take away one of those senses and it may cause you to eat more than you would normally,\" Elder said. \"The effects may not seem huge --one less pretzel-- but over the course of a week, month, or year, it could really add up.\" So next time you sit down for a meal, take your headphones off and mute the TV or find a movie where there's a lot of very audible chewing.

{"question": "In my thirty years as a Time Management speaker, I have observed a lot of what we can and should not do to increase our daily success. Time management is not necessarily working harder, but quicker and more smartly. Sometimes our mistakes will keep us from running at a full pace. Here are the top four Time Management mistakes we should all avoid to help us to increase our daily success. a. Start your day without a plan of action in the morning. If so, you will have worked hard but may not have done enough of right things. Time Management is not doing the wrong things.  b. Work with a messy desk or work area. Studies have shown that the person who works with a messy desk spends one and a half hours per day looking for things. If you have ever visited the office of a top manager who is working with a clean desk, you will find that the manager works efficiently . c. Don't get enough sleep. Studies show that nearly 75% of the people around us complain about not having  enough sleep, and then throughout their days they are tired. For most people, they get the quantity of sleep, but they lack the quality of sleep. Their days are filled with so much stress; they are out of control, working harder but maybe not more smartly, so it's difficult for them to get a full night's sleep.  d. Don't take a lunch break. Many do not take a lunch break, working through that period in the hope that it will give them more time to increase their success. Studies have shown that it may have the opposite effect. After doing what we do for several hours, we start to feel tired. A lunch break, even short, gives us a chance to get our energy back again.

Small and lovely tattoo designs are the path to go for girls planning to get tattooed for the first time. Nowadays, more and more females are getting a tattoo inked on their body. In the last fifteen years, tattoos have grown from being a sign of rebelliousness and trouble to a state of popular acceptance as a mark of fashion. Tattoos are permanent so you need to be sure that you like it before getting one. A great way is to have small tattoos that look beautiful as well. You can get a cherry blossom tattoo on the foot, perhaps, a hibiscus flower on the shoulder or a lovely butterfly on the lower stomach; whatever design you choose, it can definitely add to your attractiveness and charm. Deciding to get a tattoo needs careful thought and reflection. Otherwise, you could make some serious tattoo mistakes. Try to avoid big and obvious designs if possible. Another important part of choosing a tattoo design is the location. What part of the body do you want it on? Choosing a hidden location can often make the tattoo the perfect adornment  . As for professional women, tattoos should normally be where they can be hidden. Most importantly, no matter what tattoo design you choose the final goal is that the design should be something you like.

{"question": "Some say college is wasted on the young. So many of us look back at our own college years and realize what we could have done differently to make the most of them. While we can't go back, we certainly can offer our sons and daughters our best advice to help them make the right choices in college. Hopefully, they will have fewer regrets than we do. Following are five guidelines parents can share with their college-bound kids to put the whole experience in perspective. EDUCATION IS YOUR FIRST PRIORITY As soon as you arrive on campus, there will be competing interests. Feel free to check them out but always remember that you are there first and foremost for your education. Go to class prepared and on time. Be engaged during class. Make sure your professor knows you and realizes that you care. BE RESPONSIBLE There are many layers of responsibility. Do what you say you will do and, if you can't, own up to it early and communicate clearly. But being responsible isn't just about meeting your commitments; it is also about taking care of you, your body, and your friends. For example, more than 1800 college students die annually from alcohol-related injuries. Look out for yourself and other people. Make moderate, sensible decisions so you aren't reeling from the consequences later. TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY Incredible opportunities will present themselves: studying abroad, interning at a unique place, trying new things. Don't let fear prevent you from taking advantage of them. There may never be so much time or as many resources devoted to your betterment again in your life. Say yes to opportunities that will help you grow. FIND AND BE A MENTOR Some of the best lessons available to us can come outside of the classroom in the form of a mentor. One of the most powerful growth opportunities is being a mentor. Early on, find someone on campus who you feel can help you grow and develop a relationship with him or her. Also find someone for you to mentor. You will reinforce and enrich your own learning experience by teaching someone else. GET THE JOB DONE It is natural to occasionally feel you want to quit, when it makes more sense to you to go find a full-time job. Resist that urge. As Jocelyn Negron-Rios, a mother of two, who is currently completing her degree, advises, \"No matter how difficult it seems, keep at it because however insurmountable it feels now multiply that by 10,000 and that is how it feels when you are in your thirties with a full-time job and a family and are trying to pursue a degree.\" What is the main purpose of the passage?", "subject": "other", "choices": "['To give some rules for the college students.'\n 'To call on the students to make full use of college years.'\n 'To summarize some tips for parents to share with their children.'\n 'To analyze the benefits and difficulties of college life.']", "answer": "2"}

{"question": "Many college-bound freshmen are worrying about more than just who their roommates will be this fall. They may also be nervous about the well-known fact that they are likely to gain weight this school year. Or will they? While many of us remember the extra weight that showed up right around the start of our college careers, we are not always clear on how much weight we realize gained or why. Many nutrition experts and psychologists think that it is the change in environment and the stress of a new beginning that cause the typical college freshmen to gain extra pounds. As students start a new stage of their lives, many eat to deal with the stress of change or loneliness. Often, college students are making meals or choosing foods independently for the first time in their lives. If they live in the college dormitory, they have a wide variety of foods to select from that may be higher in calories and fatter than the foods they consumed living at home. In addition, college social events usually center around food. I clearly remember sitting in my dorm cafeteria for two or three hours on a Saturday morning socializing with my new friends. Instead of eating only one meal, we would start with breakfast, eat throughout the duration of our socializing, and finish with lunch. Food also makes an appearance after late-night parties, as part of a school day, or simply to break the monotony( ). So will this year's typical freshmen really gain 15 pounds? According to a 2006 Tufts University study, students enrolling in college this fall will gain weight, but maybe not the assumed 15 pounds.

{"question": "We often find that weekends and holidays feel so short while classes and work feel so long. In reality, though, we know that this is not true. But we still wonder where that strange feeling comes from. In fact, this is one of the ways that we're tricked by time, according to the website All That Is Interesting. The website lists several wrong impressions we often have about time. Let's have a look. First of all, emotions affect our time-keeping abilities: Negative emotions, especially anxiety and boredom, make time seem longer because they make us concentrate more on the passage of time. However, when we are enjoying ourselves, we pay more attention to what we are doing and are likely to lose track of(...) time. Here is another example. In 2007, a group of scientists carried out a test. In the test, people fell 50 meters into a safety net and were then asked about their experience. Although the experience took shorter than 3 seconds, the people thought it was much longer than it actually was. This is because of the way our bodies reply to danger, according to the scientists. Our bodies produce a chemical called adrenaline  when we are faced with danger. It allows us to concentrate better so that we can stay alive. As a result, we are able to remember far more details over a short period of time, which makes it seem like time is going more slowly. Another occasion when we make mistakes about time is when we take afternoon naps . Have you ever had trouble telling what time it is after a long nap? That's because the best amount of time for a nap is 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, you enter a new stage of sleep called slow-wave sleep. If you wake up mid-way in this stage, it will take a while before you can correctly perceive  time again. Yes, time can be mysterious and there is no way to control it So, perhaps the best thing to do is to make good use of every minute.

{"question": "Make your office space MANY of us spent our childhoods dreaming of becoming astronauts. However, the hard reality is that only a select few will make it. But does that mean you'll never get the chance to work in space? Not necessarily.     Space X, a private space company based in California, US, published a list of job vacancies   last month. These \"open positions\" are not only for astronauts, and they all sound just as cool. One of the most interesting space jobs that you may have never heard of is \"chief sniffer\" . NASA has already hired a chief sniffer named George Aldrich, whose job is to smell materials and components before they are used in spacecrafts. Using your nose at work might sound a little strange, but the job is actually crucial. A spacecraft is of limited size and  ly  high temperature, which makes smells stronger inside of it. And once a spacecraft is launched, astronauts \"have no way of escaping\" unpleasant smells, Aldrich told The Telegraph.  More importantly, smelling objects can help identify dangerous chemicals   that could threaten astronauts' health. Another job vacancy, the \"space tour guide\", may seem a little ahead of its time --after all, what's the point of hiring a tour guide when there aren't any tourists there? But in fact, many private companies are now providing space trips, and wealthy space enthusiasts   such as Justin Bieber and Sarah Brightman have already signed up for tours. It may not be long before space becomes one of the top travel destinations for Earthlings.  Being a space tour guide requires  rich knowledge of astronomy  , astrophysics   geography and history to help passengers get the most out of their journey. Tour guides also need to be excellent storytellers so that passengers can experience the true awe   of space travel. Astronauts often spend weeks or even months in a small capsule with the same group of people, which is why a \"space psychologist\" is also needed to help astronauts overcome mental challenges like feeling bored and lonely. \"We're crossing the boundaries   between science fiction and reality,\" said Rohit Talwar, chief executive of US company Fast Future Research. \"Things we've seen in the past in movies are now becoming genuine   career opportunities. \" We can conclude from the article that---------.", "subject": "other", "choices": "['a space tour guide needs both a high level of space knowledge and strong social skills.'\n 'normal people will be able to afford space travels soon.'\n 'modern astronauts feel less lonely and helpless when they work as a group.'\n 'more varied jobs will be created as space trips become more popular.']", "answer": "0"}

J.K. Rowling has been spotted at cafes in Scotland working on a detective novel, a British newspaper reported Saturday. The Sunday Times newspaper quoted Ian Rankin, a fellow author and neighbor of Rowling's, as saying the creator of the \"Harry Potter\" books is turning to crime fiction. \"My wife spotted her writing her Edinburgh criminal detective novel,\" the newspaper quoted Rankin as telling a reporter at an Edinburgh literary festival. \"It is great that she has not abandoned writing or Edinburgh cafes,\" said Rankin, who is known for his own police novels set in the historic Scottish city.

{"question": "Celebrity   has become one of the most important representatives of popular culture. Fans used to be crazy about a specific film, but now the public tends to base its consumption on the interest of celebrity attached to any given product. Besides, fashion magazines have almost abandoned the practice of putting models on the cover because they don't sell nearly as well as famous faces. As a result, celebrities have realized their unbelievably powerful market potential, moving from advertising for others' products to developing their own. Celebrity clothing lines aren't a completely new phenomenon, but in the past they were typically aimed at the ordinary consumers, and limited to a few TV actresses. Today they're started by first-class stars whose products enjoy equal fame with some world top brands. The most successful start-ups have been those by celebrities with specific personal style. As celebrities become more and more experienced at the market, they expand their production scale rapidly, covering almost all the products of daily life. However, for every success story, there's a related warning tale of a celebrity who overvalued his consumer appeal. No matter how famous the product's origins is, if it fails to impress consumers with its own qualities it begins to resemble an exercise in self-promotional marketing. And once the initial  attention dies down, consumer interest might fade, loyalty returning to tried-and-true labels. Today, celebrities face ever more severe embarrassment. The pop-cultural circle might be bigger than ever, but its rate of turnover has speeded up as well. _ and the same newspaper or magazine that once brought him fame has no problem picking him to pieces when the opportunity appears. Still, the ego's  potential for expansion is limitless. Having already achieved great wealth and public recognition, many celebrities see fashion as the next frontier to be conquered.

Bai Minghui, a Beijing-based designer, creates his artwork using Tyvek, a synthetic  paper material which is difficult to tear, waterproof and, more importantly, totally recyclable. Born to a worker family in 1983 in Tangshan, Hebei Province, Bai worked as a graphic designer at a financial magazine in Beijing after graduating from Minzu University of China. In the spring of 2008, Bai visited an exhibition about Tyvek in Beijing's 798 art zone, and then worked with the material, trying to bring his designs to life. The first thing that came into his mind was the paper wallet, a must-try handicraft assignment that most Chinese students do in elementary school. \"A paper wallet is definitely more useful than a paper crane or frog,\" Bai told Beijing Review, smiling. \"At first, many people have no idea what it is, because it looks like a piece of newspaper or an express parcel receipt, and feels like real paper.

Americail is informal and chatty. It's likely to begin with a \"Hi\" and end with a \"Bye\". The chances of Amerimail containing a smiley face or an \"xoxo\" are disturbingly high.

I was a bit terrified for a while, afraid to go back to the fence, but when I did, I noticed not more quotes but two words in entirely different handwriting had been added, \"Thank you.\" Later, I saw the old man in his front yard. He beckoned   me over and told me how my quotes had been inspiring him, how he thanked me and how he was glad to see young people still have \"values\". We are now good friend and I talk to him a lot. This experience has changed my life. I still don't know who wrote that very first quote, but if he is out there, I'd like to say \"thanks\" to that unknown friend. Why did the writer begin to write a quote on the fence?", "subject": "other", "choices": "['He wanted to practice his handwriting.'\n 'He had gotten some help from the quote.'\n 'He thought doing this was interesting.'\n \"He wanted to catch his neighbor's attention.\"]", "answer": "1"}
